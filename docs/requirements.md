## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Configuration

Suitable for testing and small deployments (1-10 subscribers):

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 2 cores (x86_64) |
| **RAM** | 4GB |
| **Disk** | 20GB free space |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps Ethernet |

### Recommended Configuration

For production deployments (10-100 subscribers):

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 4+ cores (x86_64) |
| **RAM** | 8GB+ |
| **Disk** | 50GB+ free space (SSD recommended) |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps Ethernet |

### Enterprise Configuration

For large-scale deployments (100+ subscribers):

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 8+ cores (x86_64) |
| **RAM** | 16GB+ |
| **Disk** | 100GB+ free space (SSD required) |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps+ Ethernet |

### Notes on Hardware

**CPU:**
- x86_64 architecture required (ARM64 not currently supported)
- More cores improve concurrent service restart performance
- Intel or AMD processors both work well

**RAM:**
- 2GB for NMS containers (frontend + backend + nginx)
- 2GB+ for Open5GS services (scales with number of active UEs)
- Additional memory needed for MongoDB and system overhead

**Disk:**
- SSD strongly recommended for production (faster config writes, log access)
- Space needed for:
  - Docker images (~2GB)
  - Configuration backups (~10MB per backup, grows over time)
  - MongoDB backups (~size of subscriber database)
  - System logs (~1-5GB depending on verbosity)

## Software Requirements

### Operating System

**Tested and Supported:**
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** ✅ (Primary development platform)
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** ✅ (Fully supported)
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** ⚠️ (May require Docker updates)

**Likely Compatible:**
- Debian 12 (Bookworm)
- Debian 11 (Bullseye)
- Other systemd-based Linux distributions

**Not Supported:**
- Windows (WSL2 might work but untested)
- macOS (Docker Desktop not compatible with host networking)
- Non-systemd Linux distributions

### Required Software

| Software | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Docker Engine** | 24.0+ | Container runtime |
| **Docker Compose** | v2.20+ | Multi-container orchestration |
| **Open5GS** | 2.7.0+ | 5G/4G core network |
| **MongoDB** | 4.4+ | Subscriber database |
| **systemd** | 245+ | Service management |
| **bash** | 4.0+ | Shell scripts |
| **iptables** | 1.8+ | NAT configuration (optional) |
| **chrony** | any | NTP daemon managed by the Time Server page |
| **frr** / **frr-pythontools** | 8.4.x (apt) | L3 Routing (EIGRP/OSPF/BGP) — see note below on upgrading to a from-source build |

> **FRR note:** the Ubuntu `frr` apt package (8.4.4) has known long-standing `eigrpd` assertion-crash bugs ([#943](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/943), [#3701](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/3701)) that can cause intermittent route flaps and radio (S1AP/N2) disconnects under EIGRP. The L3 Routing page's **Reinstall (Source)** tab migrates to a from-source FRR build (10.6.1+) and automatically installs its own build toolchain (`git autoconf automake libtool make libreadline-dev texinfo pkg-config libpam0g-dev libjson-c-dev bison flex libc-ares-dev python3-dev python3-sphinx install-info build-essential libsnmp-dev perl libcap-dev libelf-dev libunwind-dev protobuf-c-compiler libprotobuf-c-dev cmake` plus a from-source `libyang` build) — you don't need to install these yourself, just make sure `/opt` has at least ~3GB free before starting a build.

> **Go toolchain note:** TWAMP, MMS, VectorCore SMSC, and the QCI Hardware Test tab (under UE Validation) each build a small Go program from source, and each self-installs its own exact, pinned Go version (`1.25.6`, `1.24.5`, `1.25.0`, and `1.24.0` respectively — deliberately *not* a shared version, each pinned to that specific component's own `go.mod`) by downloading the official tarball from `go.dev/dl` at install time if the host's existing Go isn't new enough. You don't need Go pre-installed — but the host does need outbound internet access to `go.dev` the first time each of these installs. (VoWiFi is the one exception: it installs Go via the distro's own `golang-go` apt package instead of a pinned tarball.)

### Optional Module Software

Each of these is installed on-demand from its own page in the NMS UI (an "Install" button that streams `apt-get install` output live) — none of it is required for a base deployment, only if you enable that specific module.

| Module | Packages Installed | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| **IMS / VoLTE** | `kamailio kamailio-ims-modules kamailio-mysql-modules kamailio-tls-modules kamailio-extra-modules kamailio-utils-modules kamailio-presence-modules kamailio-sctp-modules kamailio-json-modules rtpengine mariadb-server bind9 bind9utils mariadb-client dnsutils git dpkg-dev libxml2-dev redis-server python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev` plus `libmariadb-dev pkg-config` for PyHSS's own build | The Diameter HSS is [PyHSS](https://github.com/nickvsnetworking/pyhss) — **installed automatically by the NMS** (cloned from GitHub, Python deps installed via pip), no separate manual install or JRE/JDK needed. `rtpengine` is only in Ubuntu's own repos from 23.04 onward — on 22.04 the NMS automatically falls back to the `ppa:davidlublink/rtpengine` PPA (via `ngcp-rtpengine` + `software-properties-common`), no manual step needed. |
| **SMS over SGs** | `osmo-stp osmo-hlr osmo-msc sqlite3` | Connects to the MME's SGs interface; OsmoHLR's subscriber DB lives at `/var/lib/osmocom/hlr.db` on the host. |
| **MMS** (**beta**) | `build-essential make git sqlite3` (plus `npm`, only if this host's Node.js didn't already provide it) + a self-installed, pinned **Go 1.24.5** toolchain | Builds VectorCore MMSC (a from-source Go MM1/MMSC implementation) plus a small companion Go reverse proxy (`mm1-msisdn-proxy.go`) rebuilt on every Configure. Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_MMS_MODULE=true`. |
| **SMS Delivery Mode: VectorCore SMSC** | `build-essential make git sqlite3` (plus `npm` if needed) + a self-installed, pinned **Go 1.25.0** toolchain | Alternative SMSC backend, same from-source Go build pattern as MMS. Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_VECTORCORE_SMSC_MODULE=true`. |
| **PSTN Gateway** (**beta**, internal-only) | `asterisk asterisk-modules` | Wires Asterisk into S-CSCF's dispatcher for internal extension-to-subscriber calling. **No public SIP trunk connectivity yet.** Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_PSTN_MODULE=true` to enable. |
| **Syslog Forwarding** | None installed — configures the host's existing `rsyslog` (present by default on stock Ubuntu Server) | Also modifies (never destructively) the host's AppArmor local-override file and adds the `syslog` system user to the `frr` group, both required for rsyslog to read logs outside `/var/log` and to read `frr.log` — both changes are additive and reversible. |
| **DNS (BIND9) / FQDN Migration Wizard** | `bind9 bind9utils dnsutils` | Shared BIND9 instance also used by IMS and VoWiFi for their own zones (see the architecture note in `CLAUDE.md` on why no module should ever `apt purge bind9` or write `named.conf.options` directly). |
| **Security Gateway (SecGW)** *(alpha)* | Not an apt package — builds **strongSwan 5.9.13** from source (`build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config bison flex libssl-dev libgmp-dev libsystemd-dev curl python3`) with a small patch to its `socket-default` plugin | Deliberately *not* the distro's `strongswan-swanctl`/`charon-systemd` packages — those default to binding the IPv4 wildcard address, which collides with VoWiFi's own IKEv2 responder on UDP 500/4500 if both are enabled. Installs entirely under its own prefix; nothing at runtime depends on distro strongSwan packages. Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_SECGW_MODULE=true`. |
| **TWAMP** | Not an apt package — a self-installed, pinned **Go 1.25.6** toolchain builds a small client+server pair from source (`github.com/ncode/twamp`) | Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_TWAMP_MODULE=true`. |
| **SNMP Monitoring** | `snmpd` | Read-only SNMPv2c agent for PRTG/similar. Disabled by default — set `ENABLE_SNMP_MODULE=true`. |
| **UE Validation** *(Beta)* | Docker images for the simulator path — `free5gc/ueransim:latest` pulled from Docker Hub, and a `srsran4g-noavx` image built locally from a Dockerfile in the repo — **plus real-hardware host packages** for its VoLTE/QCI dedicated-bearer testing tabs: `linphone-cli` and `iproute2` (apt), and a self-installed, pinned **Go 1.24.0** toolchain for the QCI Hardware Test tab's own Go+cgo build | The Docker-simulator path needs internet access to pull/build on first use, same as the main app images; the real-hardware tabs need it for `linphone-cli`/Go the same way the other from-source modules do. |
| **VoWiFi** *(alpha, highly experimental)* | Not an apt package — builds VectorCore ePDG and VectorCore AAA (Go + eBPF/XDP) from source: `clang llvm libbpf-dev erlang rebar3 git golang-go` (Go here comes from the distro's own `golang-go` package, not a pinned tarball like the other Go-based modules above) | Heaviest optional module install — a real from-source build, not a quick apt install. Needs internet access to clone both repos. Pinned to specific upstream commits (`VECTORCORE_EPDG_COMMIT`/`VECTORCORE_AAA_COMMIT`), not a branch — neither upstream repo has tags/releases yet. |

> **Open5GS source-patch note:** two specific, narrow bugs (a duplicate-`Release Access Bearers` MME race, and an SMF late-CSR issue) are fixed by an automatic from-source rebuild of just that one NF binary during Configure — you don't consciously "install" this, but the first time it runs it will `apt-get install` Open5GS's own official build dependencies (`python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel ninja-build build-essential flex bison git libsctp-dev libgnutls28-dev libgcrypt-dev libssl-dev libidn11-dev libmongoc-dev libbson-dev libyaml-dev libnghttp2-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libtins-dev libtalloc-dev meson`) if they aren't already present.

### Installation Commands

**Ubuntu 24.04 / 22.04:**
```bash
# Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Docker Compose (usually included with Docker)
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin

# Open5GS
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:open5gs/latest
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open5gs

# MongoDB
sudo apt install mongodb-org

# Verify installations
docker --version          # Should be 24.0+
docker compose version    # Should be v2.20+
systemctl status open5gs-nrfd  # Should show open5gs service
mongod --version          # Should be 6.0+
```

### DNS Configuration

Ensure DNS is working properly:
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup registry.npmjs.org

# If DNS fails, configure resolv.conf
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# Add:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 1.1.1.1

# Restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

## Network Requirements

### IP Addressing

**Static IP Recommended:**
- Makes accessing the NMS more reliable
- Required for production deployments
- Can use DHCP reservation as alternative

**Localhost Requirement:**
- MongoDB must be accessible on `127.0.0.1:27017`
- Open5GS services must be on localhost or accessible

### Port Requirements

**Required Ports (Open):**
- **8888/tcp** - NMS web interface (user access)
- Can be changed via `NGINX_PORT` environment variable

**Internal Ports (Localhost Only):**
- **3001/tcp** - Backend REST API AND WebSocket (both served on the same port since v2.0-beta_0.4 — the WebSocket upgrade is authenticated against the session cookie before the socket is accepted; there is no longer a separate 3002 listener)
- **27017/tcp** - MongoDB (localhost only, no external access)

**Firewall Configuration:**
```bash
# Allow NMS web access
sudo ufw allow 8888/tcp

# Deny direct backend access (should be proxied only)
sudo ufw deny 3001/tcp

# MongoDB should only listen on localhost
# Edit /etc/mongod.conf:
# net:
#   bindIp: 127.0.0.1
```

### Ports Used by Optional Modules

These are only relevant if you enable the corresponding module from the UI — none of them are required for a base install.

| Port | Protocol | Module | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| 80/tcp | HTTP | Core (nginx) | Web UI is also reachable here in addition to `NGINX_PORT` (default 8888) |
| 443/tcp | HTTPS | Core (nginx) | TLS vhost for `acs.sc.sercomm.com` — relays factory-reset Sercomm radios (which hardcode this ACS URL) into the local GenieACS instance |
| 514/udp or /tcp | Syslog | Syslog Forwarding | Outbound only — the NMS host connects out to *your* syslog server on this port (or whatever port you configure); nothing needs to be opened inbound on the NMS host itself |
| 5060/udp | SIP | IMS / VoLTE | P-CSCF SIP signaling |
| 3868–3871/tcp | Diameter | IMS / VoLTE | Cx (I/S-CSCF ↔ PyHSS) and Rx (P-CSCF ↔ PCRF) peer connections — all localhost-only in a single-host deployment |
| 29118/sctp | SGs | SMS over SGs | MME ↔ OsmoMSC signaling |
| 2905/tcp, 14001/tcp | M3UA / SUA | SMS over SGs | OsmoSTP internal signaling transport |
| 4222/tcp | GSUP | SMS over SGs | OsmoMSC ↔ OsmoHLR |
| 500/udp, 4500/udp | IKEv2 | VoWiFi | osmo-epdg IKEv2/IPsec (ePDG ↔ UE) — the actual internet-facing port for real handsets; localhost-only against the test emulator used during development |
| 8443/tcp | HTTPS | CBRS SAS | SAS-CBSD protocol endpoint (Sercomm radios require HTTPS) |

> **SEPP note:** SEPP's N32 port (7777, same as the other NFs' SBI port) is core, not
> optional — but unlike every other NF's SBI traffic, it's only genuinely
> internet-facing if you're doing real cross-operator roaming with a visited PLMN. In a
> single-host / lab deployment it stays localhost-only like the rest of the SBI mesh.

### Network Connectivity

**Internet Access Required For:**
- Docker image builds (npm registry, Docker Hub)
- Initial installation
- Software updates

**Can Run Offline After Installation:**
- All dependencies cached in Docker images
- No external API calls during operation
- Fully air-gapped deployment possible

### DNS Requirements

**Must Resolve:**
- `registry.npmjs.org` (for npm packages during build)
- `hub.docker.com` (for Docker base images)

**No DNS Required For:**
- Runtime operation (after images are built)
- Open5GS management
- Subscriber provisioning

## Next Steps

Once requirements are met:
1. Follow **[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)** for installation
2. Configure via **[docs/configuration.md](configuration.md)**
3. Deploy to production via **[docs/deployment.md](deployment.md)**

## Authentication Issues

### Login Page Keeps Reloading / Flashing

**Symptom:** The login page rapidly reloads in a loop without stopping.

**Cause:** Usually `COOKIE_SECURE=true` is set while the app is being served over plain HTTP. The browser silently discards `Secure` cookies over HTTP, so the session is never stored and every page load triggers a fresh auth check.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Edit .env
nano .env

# Ensure this is set correctly:
COOKIE_SECURE=false    # For HTTP deployments (default)
COOKIE_SECURE=true     # Only if serving over HTTPS

# Restart backend to pick up the change
docker compose restart backend
```

---

### Login Succeeds but Redirects Back to Login Page

**Symptom:** You enter credentials, the backend logs show `Auth: login successful`, but the page immediately shows the login form again.

**Cause:** Same as above — `COOKIE_SECURE=true` on an HTTP deployment. The session cookie is set in the response header but the browser throws it away.

**Solution:** Set `COOKIE_SECURE=false` in `.env` and restart the backend.

---

### Forgot / Lost the Admin Password

**Symptom:** Can't log in and don't know the password.

**Solution — check logs first:**
```bash
# If this was a fresh deploy the password is in the logs
docker logs open5gs-nms-backend 2>&1 | grep -A4 "FIRST RUN"
```

**Solution — reset the auth database:**
```bash
docker compose down
rm -f ./data/auth.db

# Optionally set a known password first:
# Edit .env and set FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD=your-new-password

docker compose up -d

# If you didn't set FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD, grab the generated one:
docker logs open5gs-nms-backend 2>&1 | grep -A4 "FIRST RUN"
```

> **Note:** Deleting `auth.db` only removes NMS user accounts and sessions. It does **not** affect Open5GS configuration files or the subscriber MongoDB database.

---

### API Returns 401 for All Requests

**Symptom:** All API calls return `401 Unauthorized` even after logging in.

**Causes and solutions:**

1. **Session expired** — Sessions last 24 hours by default. Log in again, or increase `SESSION_MAX_AGE` in `.env`.

2. **Cookie not being sent** — Verify `withCredentials: true` is set in the frontend axios client (it should be by default). Check browser DevTools → Network → Request Headers for the `Cookie` header.

3. **auth.db missing or corrupt:**
```bash
# Check if the file exists
ls -la ./data/auth.db

# Check volume mount
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep -A3 'app/data'

# Recreate if necessary
docker compose down
rm -f ./data/auth.db
docker compose up -d
```

4. **Backend restarted, old cookie still in browser** — Log out, clear browser cookies for this site, and log in again.

---

### Rate Limited on Login

**Symptom:**
```
429 Too Many Requests
{"error": "Too many login attempts, please try again later"}
```

**Cause:** More than 10 failed login attempts from your IP in the last 15 minutes.

**Solution:** Wait 15 minutes, then try again with the correct credentials. If you're locked out and need immediate access, restart the backend container to reset the rate limiter:
```bash
docker compose restart backend
```

---

### auth.db Permissions Error

**Symptom:**
```
Error: SQLITE_CANTOPEN: unable to open database file
```

**Cause:** The `./data` directory doesn't exist on the host, or the container can't write to it.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Create the data directory
mkdir -p ./data
chmod 755 ./data

# Verify the volume mount in docker-compose.yml:
# - ./data:/app/data

# Restart
docker compose restart backend
```

---

## Installation Issues

### Docker Build Fails with DNS Errors

**Symptom:**
```
npm error code EAI_AGAIN
npm error errno EAI_AGAIN
npm error request to https://registry.npmjs.org/ failed
```

**Cause:** Docker build containers cannot resolve DNS

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix host DNS first
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# Add these lines:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 1.1.1.1

# Restart systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

# Test DNS resolution
nslookup registry.npmjs.org

# The docker-compose.yml already uses network: host for builds
# Rebuild without cache:
docker compose build --no-cache
```

**Note:** The `docker-compose.yml` file includes `network: host` in build sections to use host DNS automatically.

---

### Port 8888 Already in Use

**Symptom:**
```
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8888: bind: address already in use
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find what's using port 8888
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8888
# or
sudo lsof -i :8888

# Option 1: Stop the conflicting service
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>

# Option 2: Change NMS port
# Edit docker-compose.yml or .env:
NGINX_PORT=8889  # Use different port

# Restart NMS
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptom:**
```
permission denied while trying to connect to Docker daemon socket
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Logout and login for changes to take effect
# Or use:
newgrp docker

# Verify
groups  # Should show 'docker' in the list
docker ps  # Should work without sudo
```

---

### Configuration Files Not Found

**Symptom:**
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/etc/open5gs/nrf.yaml'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify Open5GS is installed
dpkg -l | grep open5gs

# Check config directory
ls -la /etc/open5gs/

# If configs don't exist, install Open5GS:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:open5gs/latest
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open5gs

# Verify all 17 config files exist:
ls /etc/open5gs/*.yaml | wc -l  # Should show 16
```

---

## Docker Issues

### Container Won't Start

**Symptom:**
```
docker compose up
Container exited with code 1
```

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs nginx

# Check container status
docker compose ps
```

**Common Causes:**

1. **MongoDB not running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status mongod
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

2. **Port conflict:**
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E '8888|3001'
```

3. **Missing volumes:**
```bash
ls -la /etc/open5gs/
ls -la /var/log/open5gs/
```

---

### Containers Keep Restarting

**Symptom:**
```
docker compose ps
# Shows containers with "Restarting" status
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check restart logs
docker compose logs --tail=50 backend

# Common issues:
# 1. MongoDB connection failed
sudo systemctl status mongod

# 2. Config files not accessible
ls -la /etc/open5gs/

# 3. systemctl not working
docker exec open5gs-nms-backend systemctl --version
```

---

### Cannot Remove Containers

**Symptom:**
```
Error response from daemon: cannot remove container: container is running
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop all containers first
docker compose down

# If that fails, force stop:
docker compose down --remove-orphans

# If still stuck, force remove:
docker rm -f open5gs-nms-backend open5gs-nms-frontend open5gs-nms-nginx

# Remove all project containers:
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

---

## Backend Issues

### Backend Container Starts but API Doesn't Respond

**Symptom:**
- Container shows as "Up" in `docker compose ps`
- But `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health` fails

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker compose logs backend | tail -50

# Check if backend is listening
docker exec open5gs-nms-backend netstat -tlnp | grep 3001

# Test from inside container
docker exec open5gs-nms-backend curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

**Common Causes:**

1. **MongoDB not accessible:**
```bash
# From host
mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"

# Check MongoDB URI in backend
docker compose exec backend env | grep MONGODB_URI
```

2. **Backend crashed after start:**
```bash
docker compose logs backend
# Look for errors like:
# - "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
# - "EACCES: permission denied"
# - "MODULE_NOT_FOUND"
```

---

### systemctl Commands Don't Work in Container

**Symptom:**
```
Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
```

**Cause:** Container doesn't have proper systemd access

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify privileged mode
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep Privileged
# Should show: "Privileged": true

# Verify pid mode
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep PidMode
# Should show: "PidMode": "host"

# Verify D-Bus socket is mounted
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep -A 5 Mounts | grep dbus

# If any are wrong, fix docker-compose.yml and restart:
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Configuration Apply Fails with Validation Errors

**Symptom:**
- Click "Apply Configuration"
- Get validation error message

**Diagnosis:**
Check the validation error details in the UI or logs:
```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep -i validation
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **Invalid IP address format:**
```
Address must be valid IPv4 or IPv6
Solution: Use format like "127.0.0.1" or "2001:db8::1"
```

2. **Invalid PLMN ID:**
```
MCC must be 3 digits, MNC must be 2-3 digits
Solution: MCC like "001", MNC like "01" or "001"
```

3. **Invalid port number:**
```
Port must be between 1-65535
Solution: Use valid port numbers only
```

4. **Missing required fields:**
```
Field 'address' is required
Solution: Fill in all required fields
```

---

### Configuration Apply Succeeds but Services Don't Restart

**Symptom:**
- Configuration apply shows success
- But services show as "inactive" or "failed"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check individual service status
systemctl status open5gs-nrfd
systemctl status open5gs-amfd

# Check service logs
journalctl -u open5gs-nrfd -n 50
journalctl -u open5gs-amfd -n 50

# Check backend logs for restart attempts
docker compose logs backend | grep restart
```

**Common Causes:**

1. **Invalid YAML syntax:**
```bash
# Validate YAML manually
cat /etc/open5gs/nrf.yaml | python3 -c "import yaml, sys; yaml.safe_load(sys.stdin)"
```

2. **Service dependency issues:**
```bash
# Restart in correct order manually:
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-amfd
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-smfd
```

3. **Permission issues:**
```bash
ls -la /etc/open5gs/
# All files should be readable (644)
sudo chmod 644 /etc/open5gs/*.yaml
```

---

## Frontend Issues

### Web UI Won't Load

**Symptom:**
- Browser shows "Connection refused" or "Can't reach this page"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check nginx container
docker compose ps nginx
docker compose logs nginx

# Check if port 8888 is accessible
curl http://localhost:8888
# Should return HTML

# Check firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 8888/tcp

# Check from browser on another machine
# If that fails, check host firewall
```

---

### Web UI Loads but Shows Blank Page

**Symptom:**
- Page loads but shows white/blank screen
- Browser console shows JavaScript errors

**Diagnosis:**
Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab

**Common Causes:**

1. **API not accessible:**
```javascript
// Console shows:
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
http://localhost:3001/api/config/all
```
```bash
# Solution: Check backend is running
docker compose ps backend
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

2. **CORS errors:**
```javascript
// Console shows:
Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy
```
```bash
# Check backend CORS configuration
docker compose logs backend | grep -i cors
```

3. **WebSocket connection fails:**
```javascript
// Console shows:
WebSocket connection failed
```
```bash
# Check WebSocket server
docker compose logs backend | grep -i websocket

# Verify the backend is listening (WebSocket shares the REST port, not a separate one)
docker compose exec backend netstat -tlnp | grep 3001
```

---

### Features Not Working (Buttons Don't Respond)

**Symptom:**
- UI loads correctly
- But clicking buttons doesn't do anything

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for errors when clicking buttons
```

**Common Causes:**

1. **API endpoint returns errors:**
```bash
# Check backend logs when clicking button
docker compose logs -f backend
# Then click the button and watch for errors
```

2. **JavaScript errors:**
```javascript
// Browser console shows:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
```
```bash
# This might be a bug, check GitHub issues
# Or report a new issue with steps to reproduce
```

---

## Configuration Issues

### Changes Not Persisted After Container Restart

**Symptom:**
- Make configuration changes
- Restart container
- Changes are gone

**Cause:** Configurations not saved to host filesystem

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify volume mount
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep -A 10 Mounts | grep open5gs

# Should show:
# "Source": "/etc/open5gs"
# "Destination": "/etc/open5gs"

# If mount is missing, fix docker-compose.yml
# Then rebuild:
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Backup Creation Fails

**Symptom:**
- Click "Create Backup"
- Get error message

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backup directory exists and is writable
ls -la /etc/open5gs/backups/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/open5gs/backups/config
sudo mkdir -p /etc/open5gs/backups/mongodb
sudo chmod 755 /etc/open5gs/backups

# Check disk space
df -h /etc/open5gs
```

---

### Restore from Backup Fails

**Symptom:**
- Click "Restore"
- Services don't restart or fail to start

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backup files exist
ls -la /etc/open5gs/backups/config/<timestamp>/

# Verify backup content
cat /etc/open5gs/backups/config/<timestamp>/nrf.yaml

# Check service logs after restore
journalctl -u open5gs-nrfd -n 50
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manual restore if automatic fails:
sudo cp /etc/open5gs/backups/config/<timestamp>/*.yaml /etc/open5gs/
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-amfd
# ... restart all services
```

---

## Service Management Issues

### Services Show as "Unknown" Status

**Symptom:**
- Services page shows all services as "Unknown"
- Or services show incorrect status

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Test systemctl from container
docker exec open5gs-nms-backend systemctl status open5gs-nrfd

# If that fails:
# Check privileged mode
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep Privileged

# Check systemctl mount
docker inspect open5gs-nms-backend | grep systemctl
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure proper Docker configuration in docker-compose.yml:
# - privileged: true
# - pid: host
# - volume mount for systemctl

# Restart backend
docker compose restart backend
```

---

### Service Restart Takes Too Long

**Symptom:**
- Click "Restart"
- Operation times out or takes minutes

**Cause:** Service has dependency issues or is hung

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if service is actually stopping
systemctl status open5gs-amfd

# Check for hung processes
ps aux | grep open5gs

# Check service logs
journalctl -u open5gs-amfd -n 100
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force stop the service
sudo systemctl stop open5gs-amfd
sudo killall -9 open5gs-amfd  # If stop doesn't work

# Then start fresh
sudo systemctl start open5gs-amfd
```

---

### Bulk Restart Fails for Some Services

**Symptom:**
- Click "Restart All"
- Some services restart successfully, others fail

**Cause:** Service dependency order not respected

**Solution:**
The NMS already restarts in dependency order. If this fails:

```bash
# Manual restart in correct order:
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-scp open5gs-udr
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-udm open5gs-ausf
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-pcf open5gs-nssf open5gs-bsf
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-amf
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-smf
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-upf
sleep 2
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-mme open5gs-hss open5gs-pcrf open5gs-sgwc open5gs-sgwu
```

---

## Network Issues

### WebSocket Connection Keeps Dropping

**Symptom:**
- Real-time updates stop working
- Service status doesn't update
- Logs don't stream

**Diagnosis:**
```javascript
// Check browser console (F12)
// Look for WebSocket errors:
WebSocket connection to 'ws://...' failed
```

**Causes:**

1. **Proxy timeout:**
```nginx
# nginx config needs longer timeout
# Check nginx/nginx.conf
proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
```

2. **Firewall blocking WebSocket:**
```bash
# Ensure firewall allows WebSocket upgrade
sudo ufw allow 8888/tcp
```

3. **Backend WebSocket server crashed:**
```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep -i websocket
docker compose restart backend
```

---

### Cannot Access NMS from Other Machines

**Symptom:**
- NMS works on localhost
- But can't access from other computers on network

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check nginx is listening on all interfaces
docker compose exec nginx netstat -tlnp | grep 8888
# Should show 0.0.0.0:8888 not 127.0.0.1:8888

# Check host firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8888

# Check if Docker uses host networking
docker inspect open5gs-nms-nginx | grep NetworkMode
# Should show: "NetworkMode": "host"
```

---

### FRR `eigrpd` Crashes, Taking Down All EIGRP-Learned Routes

**Symptom:** `open5gs-frr-eigrpd` (or `frr.service`) crashes/core-dumps, and every route
learned via EIGRP on this host disappears — a full RAN outage on setups where EIGRP
carries the RAN-facing routes.

**Cause:** A long-standing, upstream-unfixed bug in FRR's EIGRP DUAL finite state machine
([FRRouting/frr#943](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/943)) — six FSM event
handlers in `eigrpd/eigrp_fsm.c` assume a lookup can never return NULL; when it does
(triggers vary, including external EIGRP neighbor events), the process asserts and dies.

**Fix (partial, not a guaranteed full resolution):** this project ships a hand-built
patch that replaces the `assert()` with a graceful skip-and-log — see
[`docs/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard-patch.md`](../docs/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard-patch.md) for the
full writeup, patch file, and build/apply steps (built on top of the **L3 Routing →
Reinstall (Source)** feature's from-source FRR 10.6.1 build). This has stopped the crash
in every case tested so far, but the underlying DUAL FSM inconsistency the patch works
around is not something this project can fully fix upstream — treat this as a real
mitigation, not a guarantee it can never recur under a scenario not yet seen.

**If you need to add a new EIGRP network statement, do not write `frr.conf` and
`systemctl restart frr`** — confirmed live, this reliably triggers the exact
crash above (twice in a row on the same change), because a restart makes
`eigrpd` reprocess the *whole* topology during a fresh neighbor resync,
which is what actually hits the FSM bug — not anything about the new
statement itself. The safe, proven method is a **live `vtysh` edit**, which
advertises the new network incrementally to the already-established
neighbor and never tears down/resyncs the adjacency:
```bash
vtysh -c "configure terminal" -c "router eigrp 1" -c "network X.X.X.X/32" -c "end"
vtysh -c "write memory"
```
This project's own DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard deliberately never auto-edits
`frr.conf` for this reason — any EIGRP `network` statement addition is left
as a manual operator step using the method above, not automated.

---

## DNS / BIND9 Issues

### Whole 5G Core Crash-Loops After DNS/FQDN Migration ("Name or service not known" / FATAL)

**Symptom:** every migrated NF (`nrf`, `scp`, `amf`, `smf`, `ausf`, `udm`, `udr`, `pcf`,
`bsf`, `nssf`, `sepp1` — anything the DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard's Phase C touched) fails
to start with something like:
```
[sock] ERROR: getaddrinfo(0:nrf.5gc.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org:7777:0x0) failed: Name or service not known
[sbi] FATAL: ogs_sbi_context_parse_server_config: Assertion `rv == OGS_OK' failed.
```

**Cause:** every 5GC NF does a strict, synchronous `getaddrinfo()` on its own
`sbi.server[].advertise` FQDN at startup and aborts fatally if it can't resolve — this
isn't SEPP-specific (an earlier assumption in project history), it's true for the whole
5GC NF set once they're on FQDN addressing. If the `5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org`
zone isn't actually resolving on this host, **every one of them** crash-loops
simultaneously, not just one.

**Diagnostic order** (each step rules something out before moving to the next):
1. Confirm the zone is actually declared: `cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local` — look for a
   `zone "5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org" { ... };` block pointing at a real file
   under `/etc/bind/zones/`.
2. Confirm the zone *file* exists and is syntactically valid:
   ```
   ls -la /etc/bind/zones/5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org.zone
   named-checkzone 5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org /etc/bind/zones/5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org.zone
   ```
   `named-checkzone` will point at the exact line if the file is malformed — BIND silently
   skips a zone it can't parse and keeps serving everything else, which is why some
   lookups work fine while this one NXDOMAINs.
3. If both look fine, check BIND's own startup log for a load error it swallowed:
   ```
   journalctl -u bind9 --no-pager | grep -i "5gc\|loading master file\|not loaded"
   ```
4. Confirm BIND has actually been restarted since the zone was last written — config file
   changes (`named.conf.local`, `named.conf.options`) are only read at start/reload, not
   watched live: `systemctl status bind9` (compare "Active since" against when the file
   was last modified), then `systemctl restart bind9` if in doubt.
5. Confirm the fix worked before restarting the NFs:
   `dig @127.0.0.1 nrf.5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org` should return an answer.
6. Only then restart the crashed NFs — they crash-looped, so `systemctl` may show them as
   `failed`, not just `inactive`:
   ```
   systemctl reset-failed open5gs-nrfd open5gs-scpd open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-ausfd \
     open5gs-udmd open5gs-udrd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-bsfd open5gs-nssfd open5gs-seppd
   systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd open5gs-scpd open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd open5gs-ausfd \
     open5gs-udmd open5gs-udrd open5gs-pcfd open5gs-bsfd open5gs-nssfd open5gs-seppd
   ```

**If you need the core running again before finishing the DNS diagnosis:** the DNS
Migration Wizard's rollback (Backup page, or its own rollback action if a migration
backup still exists) reverts every NF back to IP-based addressing, which un-blocks
startup regardless of BIND's state — use this to buy time, then come back to the zone
issue with no pressure.

**Related, already fixed (2026-07-17):** two real bugs in how modules share this single
BIND9 instance were found and fixed while chasing this class of issue — see CHANGELOG:
- IMS's configure step used to unconditionally overwrite the *entire*
  `named.conf.options` file, silently discarding any custom forwarders/listen-on another
  module (or the DNS Migration Wizard, or you by hand) had already set. Fixed: `listen-on`
  is now owned by the **DNS (BIND9) page**, which every module safely merges into instead
  of overwriting (`bind-controller.ts`'s `writeListenOn()`).
- IMS's *uninstall* flow used to `systemctl stop/disable` **and** `apt-get purge` `bind9`
  itself — since BIND is shared infrastructure (VoWiFi's zone, the DNS Migration Wizard's
  zones, SEPP's advertise FQDN all depend on it), removing IMS used to take the whole DNS
  layer down with it. Fixed: IMS's uninstall now only ever touches its own `ims.*` zone.

### `systemd-resolved` Competing With BIND9 For DNS Resolution

**Symptom:** BIND9 itself looks healthy (`systemctl status bind9` active, config valid,
`dig @127.0.0.1 <name>` works), but system-level lookups (`apt-get`, `git`, plain
`nslookup`/`ping` with no explicit server) are still inconsistent, or a manual edit to
`/etc/resolv.conf` seems to get silently reverted after a while.

**Cause:** most Ubuntu hosts run `systemd-resolved` by default, which usually manages
`/etc/resolv.conf` as a **symlink** to `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`, pointing
at its own stub listener on `127.0.0.53` — not at BIND on `127.0.0.1`. Editing
`/etc/resolv.conf` directly only sticks until `systemd-resolved` next touches it
(network change, service restart, `netplan apply`), and even when it does stick,
whichever resolver is *actually* being queried depends on which tool respects
`resolv.conf` vs. NSS vs. `systemd-resolved`'s own D-Bus API — easy to get inconsistent
results debugging with different tools.

**Diagnose:**
```
ls -la /etc/resolv.conf        # is it a symlink into systemd-resolved's territory?
resolvectl status              # shows the actually-active DNS server per interface + global
systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

**Fix** — make BIND unambiguously the system resolver, disable systemd-resolved's stub:
```
sudo sed -i 's/^#\?DNSStubListener=.*/DNSStubListener=no/' /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved

sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```
This survives reboots/network changes (no more silent reverts) since `resolv.conf` is
now a static file, not a symlink `systemd-resolved` manages.

### Specific NFs Still FATAL On Startup Even Though `nslookup` Resolves The FQDN Fine

**Symptom:** after fixing DNS/BIND9 (zone loads, `dig`/`nslookup` return correct
answers), most migrated NFs start fine, but one or two specific ones (e.g. `amfd`,
`smfd`) still FATAL-abort at startup with the exact same
`getaddrinfo(...) failed: Name or service not known` error — even though a manual
`nslookup <that exact FQDN>` run right afterward succeeds.

**First, rule out a stale failed/start-limit state** — if the affected NF hit its
FATAL abort *before* DNS was actually fixed, systemd may have hit its restart-limit
and stopped retrying; it won't auto-retry just because DNS started working
afterward:
```
systemctl status open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd   # look for "start-limit-hit"
systemctl reset-failed open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd
systemctl restart open5gs-amfd open5gs-smfd
```
This is the more common cause when it's *some but not all* NFs affected — the ones
that happened to be restarted after DNS was fixed come up fine; the ones that
weren't stay stuck in their old failed state.

**If that doesn't fix it**, this is a real, separate class of DNS bug worth knowing:
`nslookup`/`dig` speak raw DNS protocol directly and **bypass NSS (Name Service
Switch) entirely**. `getaddrinfo()` — what Open5GS NFs actually call — instead goes
through whatever `/etc/nsswitch.conf`'s `hosts:` line says. On a `systemd-resolved`
host that's often `hosts: files resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] dns` — the `resolve`
module talks to `systemd-resolved` over D-Bus, completely independent of
`/etc/resolv.conf`. So it's entirely possible for `nslookup` to succeed (it never
goes near `resolve`) while `getaddrinfo()` still fails through a stale/misconfigured
`resolve` NSS path, even after the `systemd-resolved` stub-listener fix above.

**Check:**
```
grep ^hosts: /etc/nsswitch.conf
```
**Fix** — drop `resolve` so `getaddrinfo()` goes straight through `files dns` (the
same effective path `nslookup` uses), takes effect immediately, no restart needed:
```
sudo sed -i 's/^hosts:.*/hosts: files dns/' /etc/nsswitch.conf
```
Then restart whichever NFs were still failing.

## Performance Issues

### NMS UI is Slow/Laggy

**Symptoms:**
- Pages take long to load
- Buttons slow to respond
- Scrolling is choppy

**Solutions:**

1. **Check CPU/Memory usage:**
```bash
docker stats
top
```

2. **Check if backend is overwhelmed:**
```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep -i error
```

3. **Reduce polling frequency:**
```bash
# Edit environment variable (future feature)
# Or restart with lower load
```

4. **Clear browser cache:**
```
Browser Settings → Clear browsing data
```

---

### Service Status Updates Are Slow

**Symptom:**
- Services page takes 10+ seconds to update status

**Cause:** systemctl is slow to query status

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check systemctl performance on host
time systemctl status open5gs-nrfd
# Should be < 1 second

# If slow, check systemd journal size
journalctl --disk-usage
# If > 1GB, clean old logs:
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
```

---

### Configuration Apply Takes Too Long

**Symptom:**
- Apply operation takes > 30 seconds

**Cause:** Service restarts are slow

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Time individual service restart
time sudo systemctl restart open5gs-nrfd
# Should be < 5 seconds

# Check service logs for startup issues
journalctl -u open5gs-nrfd -n 50
```

## SMF/UPF Session Counter Corruption

### `pfcp_sessions_active` / SMF Sessions Show a Negative Number in Grafana

**Symptom:**
- Grafana (or a raw scrape of `smfd`'s own `:9090/metrics`) shows `pfcp_sessions_active`
  and/or `fivegs_smffunction_sm_sessionnbr` as a **negative** number, even though real
  UEs are attached and passing traffic.
- Often shows up alongside a separate, more disruptive symptom: new attaches start
  failing with `"All IP addresses in all subnets are occupied"` from `smfd`/`upfd` logs
  even though the configured UE IP pool is nearly empty — the same underlying
  corruption also wrecks the UE IP pool allocation bitmap, not just the metric.
- Typically follows a period of **rapid, repeated failed attach / session-establish /
  teardown cycles** — e.g. a UE or test tool retrying an attach in a tight loop while
  something else (misconfigured PLMN, missing IPv6 subnet, DNS resolution failure)
  makes every attempt fail and retry quickly.

**Verify it live** (check the real numbers, don't trust the Grafana panel alone):
```bash
# SMF's own metrics (adjust address if not using the default loopback scheme)
curl -s http://127.0.0.4:9090/metrics | grep -E 'pfcp_sessions_active|sm_sessionnbr'

# Compare against UPF's own count — UPF's gauge is typically NOT corrupted,
# so it's the reliable "ground truth" to compare against:
curl -s http://127.0.0.7:9090/metrics | grep 'upf_sessionnbr'
```
If SMF's number is negative while UPF's is a plausible small positive number, this is
the bug, not a real session-count problem.

**Root cause:**
This is an **upstream Open5GS bug**, not something in this NMS. Confirmed by tracing
the exact installed version's source (`open5gs-smfd --version`, then
`git clone https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs`, checkout the matching commit):
- `pfcp_sessions_active` is incremented in exactly one place —
  `smf_sess_add_by_psi()` (`src/smf/context.c`) — the shared internal session
  allocator called from every session-creation path (GTPv1, GTPv2/S5-S8, 5G
  SM-context, 5G PDU-session).
- It's decremented in exactly one place — `smf_sess_remove()` — but that function is
  reachable from **5 different call sites** (normal teardown, collision handling in
  `smf_sess_add_by_gtp2_message` when a new CreateSessionRequest collides with an
  existing PDN connection per 3GPP TS 29.274 §7.2.1, error-cleanup in 4 other
  `smf_sess_add_by_*` wrappers, and `smf_sess_remove_all`) — with **no clamping to
  zero and no reconciliation against real session state** anywhere.
- Under normal conditions the inc/dec pairs stay balanced. Under rapid repeated
  attach/retry/teardown cycles, the SMF's own session FSM appears to hit a path where
  a removal fires without (or more times than) a matching increment, desyncing the
  gauge from the true session count. This project could not pin the exact single
  racing line with certainty from static source reading alone — confirming it would
  require live packet-level tracing under a reproduction.
- A matching historical report exists upstream:
  [open5gs/open5gs#1725 — "SMF Number Of Sessions Not Updating After UEs Have Been Deleted"](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/1725),
  same subsystem (SMF's own session gauge desyncing from real state), closed by
  maintainers with no fix or root-cause writeup. This is a known-fragile area of
  Open5GS's own metrics/session-lifecycle code across multiple versions, not a
  one-off.

**Fix / recovery** (confirmed working — resets in-memory state to the correct value):
```bash
# Must restart both together — restarting only one leaves the other holding
# stale PFCP session state for the peer that just restarted.
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-smfd open5gs-upfd
```
After the restart, re-check the metrics endpoint to confirm the counter is back to a
correct, non-negative value and that new attaches succeed again.

**Not yet implemented:** a self-healing watcher (poll the metric via the existing
Prometheus scrape, auto-restart `smfd`+`upfd` on negative, following the same pattern
as BIND9's self-healing) was scoped but deliberately deferred — documented here for
now rather than built, so a future session can pick it up if this recurs often enough
to justify the automation.

## Database Issues

### MongoDB Connection Errors

**Symptom:**
```
MongoServerError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB is running
sudo systemctl status mongod

# If not running:
sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod

# Verify MongoDB is listening
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 27017

# Test connection
mongo --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
```

---

### Subscriber Creation Fails

**Symptom:**
- Create subscriber in UI
- Get error message

**Common Causes:**

1. **Duplicate IMSI:**
```bash
# Check if IMSI already exists
mongo open5gs --eval "db.subscribers.findOne({imsi: '001010000000001'})"

# Delete duplicate if needed
mongo open5gs --eval "db.subscribers.deleteOne({imsi: '001010000000001'})"
```

2. **Invalid subscriber data:**
```bash
# Check backend logs for validation errors
docker compose logs backend | grep -i subscriber | tail -20
```

3. **MongoDB disk space full:**
```bash
df -h /var/lib/mongodb
# If full, clean up or add more space
```

---

### MongoDB Backup Fails

**Symptom:**
- Click "Create Backup"
- MongoDB backup portion fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify mongodump is available
which mongodump

# If not installed:
sudo apt install mongodb-database-tools

# Verify backup directory
sudo mkdir -p /etc/open5gs/backups/mongodb
sudo chmod 755 /etc/open5gs/backups/mongodb

# Test manual backup
mongodump --db=open5gs --out=/tmp/test_backup
```

---

## Docker Logging Issues

### Docker Container Logs Not Showing in UI

**Symptom:**
- Switch to "Docker Containers" log source
- Container list is empty or containers don't appear

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker compose ps

# Verify container names match filter
docker ps --filter "name=open5gs-nms"

# Check if backend can access Docker socket
docker exec open5gs-nms-backend docker ps
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure Docker socket is mounted
# Check docker-compose.yml for backend service:
# volumes:
#   - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

# Restart backend container
docker compose restart backend

# Verify socket permissions
ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
# Should be accessible by docker group

# If permission denied, ensure container can access socket
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock  # Temporary fix
# OR add backend container to docker group (preferred)
```

---

### Docker Logs Stream Disconnects Frequently

**Symptom:**
- Docker container logs stop streaming after a few seconds
- Connection drops repeatedly

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check backend logs for docker process errors
docker compose logs backend | grep -i "docker logs"

# Check if docker logs command is timing out
docker logs -f --tail 10 open5gs-nms-backend
# If this hangs or fails, docker daemon may have issues
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart Docker daemon
sudo systemctl restart docker

# Reduce log verbosity if logs are overwhelming
# Edit docker-compose.yml logging section:
# logging:
#   options:
#     max-size: "10m"  # Reduce from 50m

# Clear old container logs
docker compose down
docker system prune -a --volumes  # WARNING: removes unused data
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Verbose Docker Logging Not Working

**Symptom:**
- `docker compose up` output doesn't show timestamps
- Logs are not verbose enough

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify logging configuration in docker-compose.yml
# Each service should have:
# logging:
#   driver: "json-file"
#   options:
#     max-size: "50m"
#     max-file: "5"
#     labels: "service,container"

# Rebuild containers with new logging config
docker compose down
docker compose up --build

# View logs with timestamps
docker compose logs -f --timestamps

# Or view specific container
docker logs -f --timestamps open5gs-nms-backend
```

---

### Docker Socket Permission Denied

**Symptom:**
```
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Add current user to docker group (host level)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Logout and login for changes to take effect

# Option 2: Ensure backend container mounts socket correctly
# In docker-compose.yml:
# volumes:
#   - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

# Option 3: Temporary permission fix (not recommended for production)
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Verify socket is accessible
ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
# Should show: srw-rw---- 1 root docker
```

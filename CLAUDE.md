# open5gs-nms — Project Briefing for Claude

This file is for a fresh Claude Code session with zero prior context on this project.
It's a living reference, not a changelog — update it when something here goes stale
rather than leaving it wrong. `CHANGELOG.md` and `git log` are the source of truth for
history; this file is the source of truth for "how things work right now."

## What this is

A full-stack Network Management System for a real, running Open5GS LTE/5G core —
dockerized, but the core network functions (NFs) themselves run as **host systemd
services**, not containers. This is not a toy/demo app: it manages real CBRS radios
(Baicells, Sercomm), real subscribers, and a real multi-vendor RAN.

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript, port 3001. Domain/application/
  infrastructure/interfaces layered architecture (`backend/src/{domain,application,
  infrastructure,interfaces}`).
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind, served via a separate container,
  proxied through nginx.
- **MongoDB**: subscriber data, SAS grant data (`open5gs` database only — no
  second metrics database; see Traffic History below).
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: already-deployed monitoring stack
  (`open5gs-prometheus`/`open5gs-grafana`, `network_mode: host`, 30-day
  retention). Scrapes each Open5GS NF's own `:9090/metrics` (config synced by
  `sync-prometheus-config.ts`) plus the NMS backend's own `:3001/metrics` —
  Traffic History (below) is a consumer of this existing TSDB, not a new one.
- **GenieACS**: TR-069 CWMP server for radio provisioning (port 7547 CWMP, 7557 NBI).
- **nginx**: reverses everything, terminates TLS for a couple of radio-facing vhosts,
  `network_mode: host`.
- **Open5GS NFs**: NOT containerized. Real systemd units (`open5gs-nrfd`,
  `open5gs-amfd`, etc.) running directly on the host, managed by the backend via
  `nsenter -t 1 -m -u -i -p -- systemctl ...` (entering PID 1's host namespaces from
  inside the backend container). This is the single most important architectural fact
  about this project — almost everything backend-side that "does something real"
  (installs a package, writes a host config file, restarts a service) goes through this
  `nsenter` pattern (`IHostExecutor` interface, `LocalHostExecutor` implementation).

## Critical architectural patterns (read this before touching backend code)

1. **Host execution via nsenter, not Docker exec.** The backend container itself has
   almost nothing installed — it shells out to the real host via
   `nsenter -t 1 -m -u -i -p -- <cmd>` for anything that needs to run in the host's
   context (`systemctl`, `apt-get`, reading/writing `/etc/open5gs/*.yaml`, etc.). Host
   files are typically accessed at `/proc/1/root/<real path>` from inside the container.
   Every `*-controller.ts` file that manages an optional module (IMS, SMS, VoWiFi, BIND,
   chrony, syslog) follows this same shape: install (streamed apt-get via
   `nsenter`), configure (write host config files), start/stop/restart (`systemctl`).

2. **rawYaml preservation for the 17 core NFs.** Never mutate a parsed config object and
   expect it to round-trip cleanly — always work through `rawYaml` so comments/structure
   in the real YAML files survive edits. `yaml-config-repository.ts` handles this.
   The 17 core NFs (as of 2026-07-17): nrf, scp, amf, smf, upf, ausf, udm, udr, pcf,
   nssf, bsf, mme, hss, pcrf, sgwc, sgwu, **sepp1** (SEPP was added as the 17th — some
   older lists in the codebase may still say 16, that's stale, fix it when you see it).

3. **Optional add-on modules** (IMS, SMS, VoWiFi, eSIM, UE Validation, Subscriber
   Groups, Syslog Forwarding, Sercomm NR, FRR source build) are NOT part of the core-17
   bulk "Apply Config" flow — each has its own install/configure/start/stop lifecycle,
   its own controller, its own frontend page. They can be hidden entirely at build time
   via `.env` flags (`ENABLE_SMS_MODULE`, `ENABLE_IMS_MODULE`, `ENABLE_VALIDATION_MODULE`,
   `ENABLE_VOWIFI_MODULE`, `ENABLE_DNS_MIGRATION_MODULE`) — requires a frontend rebuild.

4. **BIND9 is shared infrastructure — never let one module own it exclusively.** IMS,
   VoWiFi, and the DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard all use the same single BIND9 instance for
   different zones. As of 2026-07-17: `bind-controller.ts` (the DNS/BIND9 page) is the
   sole owner of `named.conf.options` (forwarders, listen-on) — it exposes safe,
   targeted-upsert functions (`readForwarders`/`writeForwarders`,
   `readListenOn`/`writeListenOn`, both exported) that other modules import and merge
   into, rather than writing their own copy of the whole file. **If you're adding a new
   module that needs BIND to listen on a specific IP, import `writeListenOn` from
   `bind-controller.ts` and merge your IP in — do not write `named.conf.options`
   yourself.** Same rule for install/uninstall: never `apt-get purge bind9` or
   `systemctl stop/disable bind9` from a module's uninstall flow — `apt purge` wipes
   `/etc/bind` entirely including every other module's zones. Each module's uninstall
   should only remove its own `<module>.*` zone files and zone blocks.

5. **Streaming install endpoints need an nginx timeout override.** Every module's
   `/install` (and some `/uninstall`/`/remove`) endpoint uses chunked transfer encoding
   to stream `apt-get install` output live to the browser (`res.setHeader('Transfer-
   Encoding', 'chunked')`, `X-Accel-Buffering: no`). `nginx/nginx.conf`'s generic
   `/api/` location only has a 120s `proxy_read_timeout` — too short for a real
   multi-package apt install on a fresh/slow host. There's a dedicated regex location
   (`^/api/(ims|sms|vowifi|bind|chrony|syslog|swu-emulator)/(install|uninstall|remove)`)
   with a 1800s timeout, matching what FRR source-build and femto already had. **If you
   add a new streaming install endpoint, add its path to that regex or its own location
   block** — otherwise a slow install silently gets killed mid-stream and the browser
   sees a generic "network error" with no useful message.

6. **Every 5GC NF does synchronous DNS resolution of its own advertise FQDN at
   startup and fatally aborts if it can't resolve.** This is real Open5GS behavior
   (`getaddrinfo()` in `ogs_sbi_context_parse_server_config`), not a bug in this
   project — but it means: after running the DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard's Phase C, if
   the `5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org` zone isn't actually resolving on the
   host, **every** migrated NF (not just SEPP, despite what earlier project notes say)
   crash-loops simultaneously. See `docs/troubleshooting.md`'s "DNS / BIND9 Issues"
   section for the full diagnostic playbook.

7. **FRR `eigrpd` has a real, not-fully-resolved crash history.** A long-standing
   upstream FRR bug (FRRouting/frr#943) can crash `eigrpd` and take down every
   EIGRP-learned route — a full RAN outage on setups where EIGRP carries RAN-facing
   routes. This project ships a hand-built crash-guard patch
   (`docs/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard-patch.md`, applied via the FRR source-build feature)
   that's stopped every recurrence tested so far, but treat it as a mitigation, not a
   guarantee — this is why the DNS Migration Wizard deliberately never auto-edits
   `frr.conf` for anything (a subscriber's framed route, an NF's FQDN advertisement,
   etc.) — any EIGRP `network` statement addition is left as a manual, deliberate
   operator step, shown as a copy-paste hint in the UI instead of automated.
   **Confirmed live (2026-08-26), not just theoretical**: applying a new EIGRP
   `network` statement via the naive path (write `frr.conf`, `systemctl restart
   frr`) triggered this exact bug twice in a row — the crash happens while
   `eigrpd` reprocesses the *whole* topology during a fresh neighbor resync,
   not because of anything about the new statement itself (reverting the
   change and restarting again crashed identically). **The safe method,
   proven live**: apply via `vtysh -c "configure terminal" -c "router eigrp 1"
   -c "network X.X.X.X/32" -c ... -c "end"` then `vtysh -c "write memory"` to
   persist — this advertises the new network incrementally to the
   *already-established* neighbor and never tears down/resyncs the adjacency,
   so it doesn't hit the trigger. If you ever do touch `frr.conf`
   programmatically for a network statement, use the live `vtysh` method,
   never a full `systemctl restart frr`.

8. **MME hostname vs IP behavior** (4G-side version of gotcha #6): Open5GS MME also
   calls `getaddrinfo()` synchronously during config parse for SGs-AP peer addresses —
   an IP (even unreachable) always works, an unresolvable hostname aborts fatally at
   startup. `MmeEditor.tsx` shows a warning banner when a hostname is detected.

9. **SGs-AP `map` is an object, not an array** in Open5GS's MME config schema — a past
   bug class from building it as an array. If you touch `mme-config.ts` or
   `MmeEditor.tsx`'s SGs-AP section, keep this in mind.

10. **Subscriber sync reconciliation.** Both IMS (`ims-controller.ts`) and SMS
    (`sms-controller.ts`) have a `sync-subscribers` endpoint that pushes Open5GS
    subscribers into an external system (PyHSS's DB / OsmoHLR's sqlite). Both do a
    reconciliation pass after the main sync loop to delete rows for subscribers that
    were removed from Open5GS or had their MSISDN cleared — the sync loop alone only
    ever inserts/updates, so without this pass, deleted subscribers orphan forever in
    the external system. If you add a third "sync subscribers to X" feature, copy this
    reconciliation pattern, don't skip it.

11. **Per-subscriber traffic accounting owns its own nftables table.**
    `subscriber-ip-accounting.ts` is the first real nftables rule-management
    code in this codebase (as opposed to `auto-config.ts`'s pre-existing
    `iptables` NAT rules) — it installs one counter rule pair (up/down) per
    subscriber UE IP in a dedicated `inet open5gs_nms_acct` table/`acct_fwd`
    chain, matching by UE IP only (no interface matching needed — UE pool IPs
    are unique on this host). If you add another nftables-based feature,
    give it its own table rather than sharing this one, and remember: if a
    UE IP gets reassigned to a different subscriber, the old rule pair must
    be deleted and recreated (not just relabeled) so the counter resets to
    zero instead of the new owner inheriting the old owner's byte count.

12. **Traffic History reuses the existing Prometheus, it doesn't store its
    own history.** `prometheus-metrics.ts` exposes raw cumulative counters
    (`open5gs_gtp_{rx,tx}_bytes_total{dnn}`, `open5gs_subscriber_{up,down}
    _bytes_total{imsi}`) via a `/metrics` endpoint that `sync-prometheus-config.ts`
    scrapes alongside every NF — deliberately NOT a separate MongoDB
    time-series store (an earlier version of this feature used one; it was
    replaced once we realized Prometheus was already deployed and already
    doing this job). `traffic-history-controller.ts` is a thin proxy that
    turns the frontend's filter params into a PromQL `query_range` call and
    lets Prometheus's own `rate()` compute Mbps — don't reintroduce
    rate/delta math on our side. Retention is whatever Prometheus's own
    `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` is set to (shared with NF metrics), not
    independently configurable per feature.

13. **Real VoLTE calling needs the P-CSCF↔PCRF Rx interface for dedicated QCI=1
    bearers — this is now built and active, not optional.** Real phones (unlike the
    IMS Test Number bot) won't ring for a UE-to-UE call unless the network actually
    creates a dedicated GBR voice bearer (QCI=1) via Gx, which requires P-CSCF to
    speak Diameter Rx to PCRF (`ims_qos`/`cdp`/`cdp_avp` Kamailio modules, gated by
    `#!define WITH_RX` in `pcscfIncludeCfg()`'s generated `pcscf.cfg` — confirmed
    live 2026-07-26 this was fully built in a prior session but left disabled by one
    commented-out line). `pcscfDiameterXml()` deliberately has NO `<Peer>` element for
    PCRF (accept-only — P-CSCF and PCRF both trying to actively connect to each other
    causes a real, confirmed connect/disconnect flap that starves all INVITE
    processing). `upsertPcrfPcscfPeer()` cleans up stale `ConnectPeer` entries from
    old PLMNs on every Configure run — don't remove that cleanup, stale entries
    genuinely interfere with the real connection (confirmed via PCRF's own
    freeDiameter logs misrouting CEAs to a stale peer's state machine). See memory:
    ims-ue-to-ue-calling-investigation for the full debugging arc, including a
    real-radio hardware limitation (a specific eNB model rejecting QCI=1 outright,
    S1AP cause 37 `not-supported-QCI-value`) that looks identical to a software bug
    at first — don't assume every "call won't ring" report is fixable in this
    codebase; check the eNB's own S1AP response first.

14. **A real B2BUA (Asterisk) splits one call into two dialogs — rtpengine needs
    both halves of each one.** A direct real-UE-to-UE call is one shared SIP
    dialog/Call-ID all the way through P-CSCF, so rtpengine correlates the
    existing "mo request" (caller's offer) + "mt reply" (callee's answer)
    handling in `kamailio_pcscf/route/rtp.cfg` into a single complete relay
    automatically. The PSTN Gateway's Asterisk is a real B2BUA — every call
    through it is actually **two separate dialogs** with different Call-IDs
    (caller↔Asterisk, Asterisk↔callee), and each one independently needs its
    own complete offer+answer pair processed by rtpengine, or it has a relay
    allocated with nowhere to forward either phone's audio. If you're adding
    another B2BUA-style module (another gateway, an IVR, anything that
    re-originates rather than proxies), budget for this same requirement —
    it will not "just work" the way direct UE-to-UE calls do. See memory
    `pstn-rtpengine-b2bua-dual-dialog-fix` for the full arc, including two
    dead ends that looked plausible first (a Kamailio "null send_sock"
    CRITICAL error, and an Asterisk `bridge_native_rtp` bug) that were real
    but NOT the actual remaining cause once fixed — verified via a direct
    bit-level RTP payload decode (real AMR-WB frames extracted from a packet
    capture and decoded with a real decoder) before finally finding this.

15. **SecGW: every radio needs its own dedicated pool address, and Baicells vs
    Nokia use fundamentally different IPsec models — don't assume one vendor's
    approach applies to the other.** `allocatePoolAddress()` hands each radio a
    unique single-address pool/traffic-selector — never a shared CIDR (a real
    outage: shared selectors collide on one kernel XFRM policy slot, and
    whichever radio negotiates last silently steals it from the others, who
    then show ESTABLISHED in swanctl with no real traffic path). Baicells
    negotiates that address dynamically via IKEv2 Configuration Payload (CP).
    **Nokia has no CP support at all** (confirmed live 2026-08-14 by reading the
    radio's own IPsec page directly) — it only offers static tunnel endpoints +
    traffic selectors as one or more standalone "Protect" policies, so Nokia's
    `remote_ts`/`remote_addrs`/IKE identity must be the radio's own real IP
    (`localIpAddress`), never the pool/CP mechanism (see `resolveRemoteTs()`'s
    comment for the full story). A Nokia radio needing to reach anything beyond
    the auto-derived core NF pair (e.g. the BIND DNS server) needs it added via
    `extraLocalCidrs` as a real "Protect" policy on the radio's side, matched by
    widening this gateway's own `local_ts` — Nokia's "Bypass" IPsec action isn't
    reliably usable for this, don't assume it is.

16. **Cross-RAN Calling: when two sibling modules each need to read the
    other's data, only ONE direction of the cross-module import can be
    static — the other must be a lazy `await import()` at the call site, or
    it's a real load-time circular dependency.** `pstn-controller.ts` (PSTN
    Gateway's Asterisk) and `asterisk-2g-controller.ts` (Asterisk-2G) are two
    independent B2BUA instances; Cross-RAN Calling peers them with a new
    inter-Asterisk PJSIP trunk on each side (`[asterisk2g_trunk]` in
    `pjsip_pstn.conf`, `[pstn_trunk]` in Asterisk-2G's `pjsip.conf`) plus
    dialplan blocks on each side that **forward, not resolve** — dialing the
    other side's short code re-enters that side's own dialplan at the exact
    same digit string, where its own already-existing per-mapping `Dial()`
    logic completes the call unchanged (neither side ever needs to know the
    other's subscriber mapping). `pstn-controller.ts` already had a
    pre-existing static `import { isAsterisk2gInstalled } from
    './asterisk-2g-controller'` (a deliberate one-way dependency — see that
    function's own comment) — extending that SAME direction with more named
    exports (`setCrossRanPeer`, `listGsm2gShortCodesForCrossRan`,
    `getAsterisk2gEchoTestNumber`, `getAsterisk2gBindAddress`) was safe. But
    Cross-RAN Calling also needs the reverse (Asterisk-2G's own routine
    single-side short-code regen, `regenerateExtensions2g()`, needs to know
    whether to keep including PSTN's forwarding blocks — with no orchestrator
    in that call path to push the data in as a parameter) — so that direction
    uses `await import('./pstn-controller')` right at the two call sites that
    need it (a private `getCrossRanPeerCodes()` helper, and the `/extensions`
    collision guard), never a static top-level import. This mirrors the
    pre-existing `setMscMnccMode` pattern (`sms-controller.ts`, consumed via
    lazy import from both `asterisk-2g-controller.ts` and `gsm-controller.ts`)
    — **static import for a genuinely one-directional relationship, lazy
    `await import()` the moment a second file needs to import back**, in this
    codebase specifically to avoid circular static imports between sibling
    controllers. The toggle itself (`setCrossRanCalling()` in
    `pstn-controller.ts` — the sole orchestrator, since the one-button UI
    lives on the Voice Gateway page's Extensions tab, backed by `pstnApi`) is
    deliberately **fail-closed with no rollback on partial failure**: both
    dialplans are exact-match-only (PSTN's has no catch-all at all;
    Asterisk-2G's `_X.` catch-all always loses to an exact match in the same
    context regardless of declaration order), so a half-applied state — one
    side wired, the other not — just means a call fails to route on one leg;
    it can never misroute or corrupt an in-progress call, so surfacing the
    specific inconsistency and letting the operator retry is safer than
    silently reverting a flag that would then lie about a still-half-wired
    trunk. A one-time collision sweep runs at enable time across both short-
    code registries (`pstn_extensions`/`gsm2g_extensions` Mongo collections)
    and each side's echo-test number; a matching, cheaper guard is gated on
    `crossRanEnabled` (not unconditional) inside each side's own
    `POST /extensions` handler, so two operators running both modules with no
    intention of ever bridging them can still reuse the same short code
    freely on each side. Real transcoding requirement (first time this
    project transcodes real call audio, not just relays it): the new trunk
    endpoints allow both codec families (`gsm,amrwb,amr` on PSTN's side,
    `amrwb,amr,gsm` on Asterisk-2G's side — codec ORDER matters, each lists
    its own downstream leg's native codec first to bias negotiation toward
    exactly one transcode hop instead of risking two), `direct_media=no` is a
    hard functional requirement here (not just inherited B2BUA hardening
    habit — Asterisk must stay in the RTP path on both legs for transcoding
    to happen at all), and both new endpoints carry `rtp_keepalive=5` from
    day one (the no-audio bug fixed live 2026-09-14, see the PSTN/Asterisk-2G
    entries above — this risk is generic to any `rtp_symmetric`-dependent
    B2BUA leg, so it's applied proactively here rather than waiting to
    rediscover it). Confirmed live 2026-09-14: enable/disable cycle produces
    working PJSIP endpoints and dialplan routing on both instances with zero
    impact on the pre-existing `scscf_trunk`/`sipconn` trunks, and the
    collision sweep correctly rejects a deliberately-colliding test code
    before writing anything. **Real over-the-air calls confirmed working
    2026-09-15, both directions, full bidirectional audio (packet-verified)**
    — getting there also surfaced and fixed a real, separate `osmo-bsc.cfg`
    bug unrelated to this feature's own code: `codec-support fr` was
    under-declaring the real nanoBTS's own AMR capability (it genuinely
    supports AMR per its own live OML Feature Vector), which had been
    misdiagnosed the day before as an unfixable hardware RF reliability
    issue. Fixed to `codec-support fr amr` in `gsm-controller.ts`'s
    `btsBlock()`. See memory: `gsm_2g_osmocom_module_progress.md` for the
    full arc — if a 2G TCH-assignment failure ever resurfaces, check
    `show bts 0`'s live `Features:` list against `codec-support`/
    `amr-config` before assuming it's hardware again.

17. **SigScale OCS (Diameter Gy charging): `smf.conf` now has THREE
    independently-owned `ConnectPeer` lines — Gx (Open5GS core, untouched by any
    module), S6b (VoWiFi's `aaa.*` identity prefix), and Gy (this module's `ocs.*`
    prefix) — each module's upsert function must regex-strip ONLY its own
    prefix, never the whole file.** `upsertSmfGyPeer()`/`removeSmfGyPeer()`
    (`ocs-controller.ts`) are a direct copy of VoWiFi's own `upsertSmfAaaPeer()`/
    `removeSmfAaaPeer()` idiom (`vowifi-controller.ts:514-556`), scoped to
    `/^[ \t]*ConnectPeer\s*=\s*"ocs\.[^"]*"[^\n]*\n?/gm` — this exclusive `ocs.`
    naming slot is what keeps this module's writes from ever touching VoWiFi's
    `aaa.*` line or vice versa. Each module also keeps its own, separate
    one-time backup file (`HOST_SMF_CONF_BAK = .../.ocs-smf-conf.bak`, distinct
    from VoWiFi's own) — never share a backup filename between two modules that
    both write into the same live file, or the second module's first-write
    backup silently clobbers the first module's original. **Gy is 4G/EPC-only —
    SigScale also ships a 5G product (`sigscale/chf`), explicitly excluded from
    this module's scope**: Open5GS's SMF has zero Nchf client implementation
    upstream (confirmed live against the real `open5gs/open5gs#4421` GitHub
    discussion — a community proposal exists, not merged, no timeline), so
    wiring CHF too would have nothing on the SMF side to ever call it; a 5G NR
    UE's session is never charged/controlled by this integration at all. Four
    real bugs found live getting the Gy peer to actually connect (not just
    "config written, restart succeeded"): (1) OCS's default HTTP port 8080
    collides with PyHSS's own API service (`/opt/pyhss/services/apiService.py`)
    — moved to `8093` after confirming 8090/8091/8092 were also taken by other
    modules; (2) OCS's default `0.0.0.0:3868` Diameter bind can silently lose to
    another NF's dedicated-IP freeDiameter listener while the Erlang `diameter`
    application still reports its supervisor "up" — gave OCS its own dedicated
    loopback `127.0.1.10`, matching every other per-daemon-loopback module in
    this project; (3) **OCS is NOT accept-by-default for Diameter peers** — it
    rejects an unrecognized peer with `3010/DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_PEER` until
    explicitly registered via `ocs:add_client/6`, called over RPC into the real
    running node (`rpc:call('ocs@open5gs-core', ocs, add_client, [...])` in
    `addSmfAsOcsClient()`) — a fresh throwaway Erlang node can't call this
    directly, `add_client` needs Mnesia, which only runs on the real node; (4)
    OCS's default `Origin-Host`/`Origin-Realm` derive from
    `inet:gethostname()`/DNS search domain (confirmed live: `open5gs-core`/
    `example.net` on this host, neither PLMN-related), not anything
    deployment-specific — freeDiameter rejects the CEA outright until
    `sys.config`'s diameter options set these explicitly
    (`originHost`/`originRealm` in `ocs-controller.ts`, defaulting to
    `ocs.epc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org`, derived live from
    `mme.yaml` — matching the `pcrf.epc...`/`aaa.epc...` naming convention
    already used for SMF's other peers). `ENABLE_OCS_MODULE` defaults
    **disabled** (opt-in) — touches an always-on core NF's freeDiameter peer
    list, same caution class as VoWiFi's S6b line.

18. **cdp (Kamailio's own Diameter module, used by P/I/S-CSCF) behaves
    differently from freeDiameter (used by every core NF + VoWiFi + OCS's Gy
    peer) in two real, confirmed-live ways — don't assume freeDiameter
    knowledge transfers.** Found wiring S-CSCF's Ro (voice/airtime charging,
    Diameter Application-Id 4 — the same Credit-Control application Gy uses,
    confirmed via `ocsSysConfig()`'s generic per-application acct/auth
    structure, so no new OCS-side listener was needed) to SigScale OCS: (1)
    **cdp resolves `<Peer FQDN="...">` via a real synchronous `getaddrinfo()`
    at connect time** — same "DNS or die" shape as gotcha #6, just for cdp
    instead of a core NF's own advertise FQDN. freeDiameter's `ConnectPeer`/
    `ConnectTo` takes an IP directly and never needed this, so SMF's own Gy
    peer never surfaced it. If you add a `<Peer>` whose FQDN isn't already
    covered by this file's own IMS BIND zone, add an `/etc/hosts` entry for
    it too (`upsertOcsHostsEntry()` in `ims-controller.ts` is the reusable
    pattern — mirrors the pre-existing HSS peer's own `/etc/hosts` line,
    `configureIms()` step 9) or cdp fails with a real, reproduced "Name or
    service not known". (2) **cdp does not bind its outbound Diameter
    connection to the peer's own configured listen address — freeDiameter
    does.** Registering S-CSCF's real configured IP (`scscfIp`, e.g.
    `127.0.1.2`) as OCS's trusted client produced a real, reproduced
    `3010/DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_PEER` rejection — OCS's own log showed the
    connection actually arriving from `addresses: [{127,0,0,1}]`, confirmed
    via `kamcmd -s /run/kamailio_scscf/kamailio_ctl cdp.list_peers` (shows
    live per-peer `State`, e.g. `I_Open`, plus negotiated Application-Ids —
    the cdp equivalent of freeDiameter's `STATE_OPEN` grep-the-log check).
    `ims-controller.ts` now has a dedicated `OCS_CLIENT_SOURCE_IP =
    '127.0.0.1'` constant, always registered instead of `scscfIp` — this is
    a genuine cdp behavioral difference, not host-specific config, so it
    should hold for any future cdp-based Diameter peer this project adds,
    not just OCS.

## Feature inventory (as of v2.0-beta_0.61, 2026-09-21)

| Feature | Status | Key backend files | Key frontend files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core 17 NF config | stable | `yaml-config-repository.ts`, `apply-config.ts`, `config-controller.ts` | `ConfigPage.tsx` + `editors/*.tsx` |
| SEPP (N32 roaming) | stable | `sepp-controller.ts`, `sepp-config.ts` | `SeppEditor.tsx` |
| Framed Routing | stable | `subscriber-management.ts`, `ip-utils.ts` | `SubscriberPage.tsx` |
| DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard | stable, actively used | `dns-migration-usecase.ts`, `dns-migration-controller.ts`, `bind-controller.ts` | `DnsMigrationPage.tsx`, `BindPage.tsx` |
| IMS / VoLTE (PyHSS-based) | beta — real UE-to-UE calling with full audio confirmed working end-to-end over **direct IMS** on real iPhone hardware, PLMN 001-01 (2026-07-26), incl. dedicated QCI=1 bearers via the P-CSCF↔PCRF Rx interface. **iPhone-only** — Android as callee (both direct IMS and via PSTN Gateway) currently fails; root cause not yet found (2026-07-29) | `ims-controller.ts` | `IMSPage.tsx` |
| SMS | stable — **SMS over IMS is the default/primary path** (real phones prefer it whenever IMS-registered anyway; this is also the confirmed-working baseline). SMS over SGs (osmo-\*) is available as an opt-in, experimental alternative via a "SMS Delivery Mode" toggle on the SMS/MMS page (`POST /api/ims/sms-delivery-mode`) — selecting it hard-blocks SIP MESSAGE at S-CSCF (`#!ifdef BLOCK_IMS_SMS` in `kamailio_scscf.cfg`) so it can't silently fall through to peer-to-peer IMS delivery instead. Real two-UE SGs delivery has an open, unresolved bug (P-CSCF `ims_ipsec_pcscf` failing to relay a locally-generated reply back through the IPsec tunnel — see memory: sms-over-ims-vs-sgs-delivery-mode) — don't enable SGs mode without reading that first. Both `sms-controller.ts` and `ims-controller.ts` are involved; `configureIms()`/`/status` both default fresh deployments to `'ims'`. | `sms-controller.ts`, `ims-controller.ts` | `SMSPage.tsx` |
| MMS (VectorCore MMSC) | beta — real end-to-end MMS confirmed working on a real UE (2026-07-30), after fixing two real bugs: VectorCore logs its whole MM1 request path at Debug while shipping configured at Info (looked exactly like requests weren't reaching the app at all — set to `debug`), and real phones send MMS PDUs with no usable `From` field, which VectorCore expects a GGSN/PGW-style `X-MSISDN` HTTP header to supply. Fixed with a small compiled-Go reverse proxy (`mm1-msisdn-proxy.go`, its own `vectorcore-mm1-proxy` systemd unit, built during every Configure from the same already-guaranteed Go toolchain — deliberately not Node, which isn't a documented prerequisite anywhere in this project) sitting in front of VectorCore's real public `:8002`, resolving sender MSISDN from the UE's Framed-Routing IP and injecting the header — see memory: `mms-mm1-msisdn-header-injection-fix`. `ENABLE_MMS_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in). Lives as a second tab on the SMS/MMS page, not a separate nav entry. | `mms-controller.ts` | `SMSPage.tsx` (MMS tab) |
| PSTN Gateway (Asterisk, internal-only) | **beta — no public SIP trunk yet**; signaling AND audio both confirmed working end-to-end (full duplex, both call directions, both the PSTN-extension dialing method and normal MSISDN dialing, over VoWiFi) as of 2026-08-16 — see `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s newest Handoff Summary entry for the four real bugs (an S-CSCF self-relay loop, a dead rtpengine session-learning guard, an Asterisk config-file ownership bug, and a cross-leg RTP payload-type mismatch) found and fixed to get there. Earlier same-day-regression history is stale — don't assume audio is broken without re-verifying live. **Cross-RAN Calling** (one toggle on the Voice Gateway page's Extensions tab) bridges this instance to Asterisk-2G — see architectural pattern #16 for the full design; confirmed live 2026-09-15 with real over-the-air calls in both directions, full bidirectional audio (packet-verified) — getting there also required a real `osmo-bsc.cfg` fix (`codec-support fr` → `fr amr`), see pattern #16's tail and memory `gsm_2g_osmocom_module_progress.md`. `ENABLE_PSTN_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in) | `pstn-controller.ts`, `asterisk-2g-controller.ts` | `PstnGatewayPage.tsx` |
| VoWiFi (ePDG) | alpha, experimental | `vowifi-controller.ts`, `vowifi-build.ts` | `VoWiFiPage.tsx` |
| eSIM generation (Simlessly API) | stable | `esim-generator.ts`, `esim-controller.ts` | `EsimGeneratorModal.tsx` |
| Subscriber Groups | stable | `subscriber-groups-controller.ts` | `SubscriberPage.tsx` (grouping UI) |
| Syslog Forwarding | stable | `syslog-controller.ts` | `SyslogForwardingModal.tsx` |
| Major Event Classification | stable | `major-event-classifier.ts` | `MajorEventsView.tsx` |
| FRR source build + crash-guard patch | stable | `frr-source-build.ts`, `frr-source-build-controller.ts` | `FrrSourceBuildTab.tsx` |
| Sercomm NR provisioning | stable | `sercomm-nr-controller.ts` | `SercommNRTab.tsx` |
| UE Validation (UERANSIM 5G + srsRAN 4G) | stable | `validation-controller.ts` | `ValidationPage.tsx` |
| CBRS SAS server | stable | `sas-service.ts`, `sas-controller.ts` | `SASPage.tsx` |
| GenieACS radio provisioning | stable | `genieacs-controller.ts` | `AutoConfigPage.tsx`, `FemtoConfigTab.tsx` |
| Traffic History (aggregate + per-subscriber) | stable | `subscriber-ip-accounting.ts`, `prometheus-metrics.ts`, `traffic-history-controller.ts` | `TrafficHistoryPage.tsx` |
| Security Gateway (SecGW) | alpha — real IPsec tunnels confirmed live for both radio vendors simultaneously: 3 Baicells eNBs (IKEv2 Configuration Payload/virtual-IP based) and 1 Nokia AirScale (static tunnel endpoints + traffic selectors, no CP) — real S1AP/GTP-U traffic verified flowing through the tunnel via packet capture (ESP wrapper + decrypted SCTP heartbeat to MME, 2026-08-14). See architectural pattern #15 for why Baicells and Nokia are configured completely differently. `ENABLE_SECGW_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in). | `secgw-controller.ts`, `secgw-build.ts` | `SecGWPage.tsx` |
| RF Planning | **alpha, actively being built out** — deterministic LTE link-budget/site-geometry engine (Phase 1 of a planned multi-phase tool, see memory: `rf_planning_tool_phase1_plan`); expect incomplete phases and possible breaking changes between releases. `ENABLE_RF_PLANNING_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in). | `rf-planning-controller.ts`, `rf-planning-projects-controller.ts`, `rf-planning-reports-controller.ts` | `RfPlanningPage.tsx` |
| UE Signal Monitoring | **new, community-contributed** (PR #32) — per-UE RSRP/RSRQ/SINR/BLER/MCS/CQI/throughput correlated with subscriber identity (IMSI/ICCID/MSISDN), 7-day SQLite history, AES-256-GCM encrypted radio credentials, admin-triggered downlink wake for idle UEs. **Baicells-native connector only** — other vendors need the generic JSON connector, which requires the radio to already expose its own metrics in that shape, so it is not a drop-in for every vendor. `ENABLE_UE_SIGNAL_MODULE` defaults **enabled** (set to `false` to hide it — this is a visibility gate, not an install/uninstall lifecycle like most other opt-in modules). | `radio-signal-controller.ts` | `RadioSignalPage.tsx` |
| 2G GSM (Osmocom) | **alpha** — real GSM radio access (osmo-bsc/osmo-bts) layered on the osmo-hlr/osmo-msc/osmo-stp that SMS-over-SGs already runs, on real nanoBTS hardware confirmed on-air. CS attach/ciphering, GPRS/EDGE data, and 2G↔4G SMS (via VectorCore SMSC, its own separate module) are **stable**. Real voice calling is **alpha**: osmo-msc's own built-in call handler can complete signaling (ring/answer) but never implements `MNCC_RTP_CREATE` (confirmed live 2026-09-13, upstream Osmocom limitation, not fixable here) — no audio ever flows in Internal mode. Real 2G↔2G audio needs External mode routed through **Asterisk-2G**, a second, fully isolated Asterisk instance (own config tree, own systemd unit, own loopback IP `127.0.1.7` — never touches the separate Asterisk instance PSTN Gateway owns) whose only job is looping a call back through osmo-sip-connector so the second phone gets paged. One button (GSM page's "2G Voice" tab, gated on `ENABLE_ASTERISK_2G_MODULE`, defaults **disabled**) installs, configures, wires the SIP tab's remote peer, and switches MNCC to External automatically. `ENABLE_GSM_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in) — real radio (and, for a real BTS, actual spectrum transmission) is a bigger blast radius than a broken lab feature. If a real call ever fails at TCH assignment (osmo-bsc logs "Assignment Failure"/"NACK on IPACC CRCX"), it is NOT necessarily a hardware issue — see architectural pattern #16's tail and memory `gsm_2g_osmocom_module_progress.md`: a real `codec-support`/AMR config mismatch caused exactly this, confirmed live 2026-09-15, and had been misdiagnosed as unfixable hardware the day before. | `gsm-controller.ts`, `asterisk-2g-controller.ts`, `osmo-sip-connector-build.ts` | `GsmPage.tsx` |
| 3G UMTS (OsmoHNBGW) | **alpha** — Home NodeB Gateway bridging a 3G femtocell's Iuh interface to the existing osmo-msc (IuCS) and osmo-sgsn (IuPS) over the already-running osmo-stp. `osmo-hnbgw` isn't an apt package on this host — built from source, pinned to tag `1.3.0` (NOT the `1.9.0` every other daemon here uses — its own version numbering is independent, and `1.9.0` needs a newer `libosmocore` than this host has; confirmed live 2026-09-13 via a real scratch build). Adds a new `cs7`/IuPS point-code block into the 2G module's own `osmo-sgsn.cfg` via ownership-merge (never a blind overwrite — see `vty-config-ownership.ts`), and a third, dedicated OsmoMGW instance (own config/systemd unit/loopback `127.0.1.8`, reusing the already-installed `osmo-mgw` binary). `osmo-stp.cfg`/`osmo-msc.cfg` need **zero changes** — confirmed live from both HNBGW's and MSC's own logs (STP's existing dynamic-ASP-registration + MSC's existing SCCP link both already handle it). Subscriber credentials need no new provisioning either — reuses the 2G module's own `gsmEnabled` flag and its `auc_3g` MILENAGE row (confirmed via OsmoHLR's own manual: the same row serves both 2G and full UMTS AKA). A software test HNB, **OsmoHNodeB** (tag `0.1.0`, same source-build pattern, needs its own dedicated GTP-U bind `127.0.1.9` — its default collides fatally with Open5GS's own UPF), deployable from the module's own page, proved a full live HNBAP registration end-to-end before any real hardware was touched. Real hardware target: an ip.access nano3G — unlike 2G's OML, Iuh/HNBAP has no remote-provisioning push, so a real HNB self-registers once pointed at this gateway's IP on its own local config, rather than being discovered/pushed-to from this NMS. `ENABLE_HNBGW_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in). | `hnbgw-controller.ts`, `osmo-hnbgw-build.ts`, `osmo-hnodeb-build.ts` | `HnbPage.tsx`, RAN page's "3G UMTS" section |
| SigScale OCS (Online Charging, Diameter Gy) | **beta** — real-time prepaid credit-control charging for 4G/EPC PDN sessions, wiring Open5GS SMF's own native Gy client (present since v2.4.7, previously completely dormant in this deployment) to a newly-installed SigScale OCS (Erlang/OTP, real apt package via a pinned Google-Cloud-hosted `.deb`, not source-built). Full one-button Configure: writes OCS's own `sys.config`, registers SMF as a trusted Diameter client via `ocs:add_client/6` (RPC into the real running node — Mnesia only works there, not on a throwaway node), upserts the `ocs.*` Gy `ConnectPeer` into `smf.conf`, restarts `open5gs-smfd`, and verifies a real `STATE_OPEN` Gy connection from SMF's own log — end-to-end confirmed live 2026-09-16. **4G/EPC only — 5G NR sessions are never charged by this integration**; see architectural pattern #17 for why SigScale's 5G product (`chf`) was researched and explicitly excluded (Open5GS SMF has no Nchf client upstream). Pattern #17 also covers the 4 real bugs found getting the Gy peer to actually connect (port conflict, wildcard-bind conflict, default-deny client registration, Origin-Host/Realm mismatch) and the exclusive-naming-slot scheme that lets this module and VoWiFi both safely own one `ConnectPeer` line each inside the same `smf.conf`. No rating-plan/balance/subscriber CRUD in this NMS — Setup tab links out to OCS's own Polymer web GUI and REST API docs instead, matching this project's established "link out, don't reimplement" convention for full third-party apps. **Voice/airtime charging (Diameter Ro), added 2026-09-17, confirmed fully working end-to-end** — completes the dormant `#!ifdef WITH_RO` block `kamailio_scscf.cfg` already carried (same "built, left disabled" shape as pattern #13's Rx interface); shares OCS's existing Gy listener (same Diameter Application-Id 4), new `setVoiceChargingEnabled()`/`POST /api/ims/voice-charging` toggle (in `ims-controller.ts`, defaults **off**, same risk class as Gy). Getting a real call to actually complete took 2 cdp-vs-freeDiameter connectivity bugs (architectural pattern #18) plus **five separate real bugs inside the compiled `ims_charging.so` module itself** — duplicate Origin-Host/Realm AVPs, two AVPs that don't belong in a CCR at all (Accounting-Record-Type/Number, Vendor-Specific-Application-Id), a missing mandatory Auth-Application-Id, and a subscriber-identity format (`sip:` URI vs `tel:` URI) OCS's lookup didn't recognize — every one confirmed via OCS's own `erlang.log`, not guessed. All five are now real unified-diff patches baked into `kamailio-ims-modules-build.ts` (`CCR_C_PATCH`/`IMS_RO_C_PATCH`, same `apt-get source` → `patch` → build → ABI-verify → `.apt-original`-backup → deploy pipeline already used for `ims_ipsec_pcscf`/`ims_registrar_pcscf`), not just hand-patched on one host — independently verified by running the real generator script end-to-end against a fresh source fetch. Full bug-by-bug writeup: memory `sigscale_ocs_module_progress`. `ENABLE_OCS_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in). | `ocs-controller.ts` | `OcsPage.tsx` |
| Charging Plans (simple data + voice caps GUI) | **beta, voice half confirmed working end-to-end 2026-09-17** — a deliberately simplified layer over SigScale OCS's own full rating-plan vocabulary, per explicit user request ("the sigscale gui is to complex"). One GUI "Plan" (name + data cap GB + voice cap minutes) = one OCS bundle offer referencing a data sub-offer (`specification="4"`) and a voice sub-offer (`specification="5"`, source-confirmed correct against the real rating engine's `?IMSVOICE` guard). New `nms_charging_plans` Mongo collection mirrors Subscriber Groups' own CRUD/assignment shape exactly; subscriber assignment reachable both from the Subscribers page's bulk-select toolbar AND a per-row "Set plan" control in the Plan column (added after the bulk-only flow proved hard to discover). **Real bug, found chasing a usage readout stuck at 0 despite a confirmed real charge**: `assignSubscribersToPlan()` linked a subscriber's IMSI and MSISDN to OCS **separately**, landing them on two disconnected products with independent buckets — Gy (data) keys off IMSI, Ro (voice) keys off MSISDN, so a subscriber's data and voice usage silently drew from unrelated pools. Fixed to link every identity for one subscriber to a single shared product atomically; full mechanics (including a second bug in the fix's own "already linked" short-circuit) in memory `sigscale_ocs_module_progress`. Depends on SigScale OCS being installed/configured first; the voice half additionally depends on the Ro toggle above. **An "Unlimited" plan (1,000,000 GB / 1,000,000 min — a deliberately huge finite cap, not a dedicated no-cap code path, to avoid exercising an untested interaction with the still-unresolved `charge2` crash below) is auto-provisioned by `ensureDefaultUnlimitedPlan()` on every OCS Configure, idempotent by plan name.** A cap at/above 100,000 GB or minutes renders as "Unlimited" in the UI instead of the raw number (`ChargingPlansPage.tsx`, `TrafficHistoryPage.tsx`, and the Subscribers page's plan dropdown all apply this). A real, still-unresolved **OCS-side rating-engine bug** (`ocs_rating:charge2`, `function_clause` on `type: final`/termination) periodically leaks stuck Gy/Ro reservations across multiple subscribers — no longer needs manual intervention: `OcsReservationGuard` (`backend/src/application/use-cases/ocs/ocs-reservation-guard.ts`, started unconditionally in `index.ts`, on by default) sweeps every 30 minutes and clears any reservation entry older than 2 hours via a balance-preserving Mnesia write (`remain` never touched, verified live). The deep root cause itself is still not fixed (no exact-version source obtainable for the installed 3.4.73 release, and the `.beam` has neither debug info nor an exported `charge2` to probe) — the guard is a mitigation, not a patch. Full diagnostic arc, including a complete captured crash dump and the recommended next step (file it as a SigScale GitHub issue), in memory `sigscale_ocs_module_progress`. | `charging-plans-controller.ts`, `ocs-reservation-guard.ts` | `ChargingPlansPage.tsx` |
| Call History (CDR module) | **beta** — unified call detail records across PSTN, 2G, and 4G/5G IMS, synced into a new `nms_cdr` Mongo collection (retention-configurable TTL index, default 180 days) from each system's own real source rather than a new primary store (same CLAUDE.md pattern #12 distinction as Traffic History vs. Prometheus). Three independent phases, staged by risk: **Phase 1** (PSTN Gateway Asterisk CSV tailing) stable, verified against a real 76+-row dataset. **Phase 2** (Asterisk-2G) — fixed a real bug where `asterisk-2g-controller.ts` never created the `cdr-csv/` subdirectory `cdr_csv.so` needs, so it silently never wrote a single record; code deployed, but a real end-to-end test-call confirmation is still outstanding. **Phase 3** (direct 4G/5G IMS-to-IMS calls, the one path with no B2BUA CDR of its own) — Kamailio's own `acc` module, basic flag-based `db_flag`/`db_missed_flag` accounting (deliberately NOT `acc`'s newer `cdr_enable`, which needs a module literally named `dialog` that this deployment doesn't load — see `ims-controller.ts`'s `scscfIncludeCfg()` comment), gated behind its own `WITH_CDR` build flag plus a runtime toggle (`setCdrAccountingEnabled()`, "Direct IMS Call Recording" on the Call History page's Settings panel) independent of the module's own compile-time gate, same shape as OCS's Ro toggle. **Confirmed fully working end-to-end live 2026-09-17** against 3 real test calls (answered, a rang-then-fell-to-voicemail call, and a PSTN-Gateway-routed call captured correctly as its real two separate B2BUA-split dialogs) — see architectural pattern #16's sibling gotcha (added this same day) on why the live host's static template was stale and needed a manual redeploy before the toggle could do anything. `missed_calls` (busy/rejected calls) is implemented per Kamailio's well-documented, stable module behavior but not yet empirically verified live — no real busy-call test was available this session. A voicemail pickup is indistinguishable from a normal human answer at the SIP/`acc` level (both are real 2xx-terminated INVITE transactions) — documented in the UI's info banner, not a bug. Full arc: memory `cdr_module_progress`. | `cdr-store.ts`, `cdr-sync-monitor.ts`, `cdr-controller.ts` | `CallHistoryPage.tsx` |

| IP Plan Tool | **beta** — bulk re-address a whole deployment from one page instead of visiting every module's own, via an explicit "Propose → review → Apply" flow (never an ambient background sync — a full redesign after direct user correction of the original silent-write-back version). `GET /api/ip-plan` always reads each module's own **current** live state fresh, never a registry; `POST /api/ip-plan/propose {subnet}` is a pure preview computing non-colliding suggestions (`ip-suggest.ts`); `POST /api/ip-plan/apply` is the only write path, an async job (`ip-plan-apply-usecase.ts`, same polling pattern as `module-fixall-usecase.ts`) that live-applies opt-in-per-row for secgw-gateway/vowifi-epdg/gsm-bsc-mgw+gsm-sgsn-gb/ims-pcscf+ims-rtpengine/pstn-external-trunk/mms-mm1/all 7 core-17 address fields (batched into one `AutoConfigUseCase.execute()` call, `applyInterfaces`/`applyPfcp` toggled only for groups actually touched, `localUpfOnly`/`localSgwuOnly` explicitly forced off when a PFCP field is checked since that flag would otherwise silently no-op the change) — while sepp-sbi/sepp-n32c/sepp-n32f/bind-dns are **registry-only, unconditionally**, since SEPP's only live-apply path is a full 17-NF core restart, disproportionate for 3 fields. IMS is ordered before PSTN/MMS in the same batch (both depend on it) with an explicit short-circuit if IMS's own step fails partway through a run. The old bulk-save route and its frontend client method were deleted outright as part of the rewrite (not just stopped being called) — a deliberate verification mechanism so any stale call site fails to compile instead of silently doing nothing; confirmed zero remaining `ipPlanApi.save()` call sites anywhere in the frontend. **Not yet independently confirmed with a live Propose → Apply click-through** — built and audited against its own approved plan with no deviations found, but that audit was a static code read, not a live test. | `ip-plan-controller.ts`, `ip-plan-apply-usecase.ts`, `ip-suggest.ts`, `main-interface.ts` | `IpPlanTab.tsx` (a tab on the Auto-Configuration Wizard page) |
| RAN Kill Switches (Dashboard) | **beta** — five header buttons (Block RAN, plus Block 2G/3G/4G/5G individually) that bulk-block every currently connected/registered radio of that generation, each flashing red (`animate-flash-red`) for as long as anything of that generation is currently blocked and doubling as the unblock-all action while flashing (explicit user request). 4G (`radio-block-controller.ts`) and 5G (`gnb-block-controller.ts`) reuse pre-existing nftables mechanisms unchanged. **3G had no blocking mechanism of any kind before this feature** — built `hnb-block-service.ts`/`sqlite-hnb-block-repository.ts`/`hnb-block-controller.ts` from scratch mirroring `gnb-block-service.ts`'s exact shape (own nftables table `open5gs_nms_hnb_block`), with one real difference from every other generation's block service: HNBGW's Iuh port is operator-configurable in this project (`HnbgwState.iuhLocalPort`, unlike S1AP/NGAP's fixed 3GPP port numbers), so the service reads it live via an injected `getIuhPort()` callback and encodes the port into each rule's own tracking comment (`hnb_block_<ip>_<port>`) so a port change while blocked is detected as "no longer desired" by the existing reconcile loop instead of silently leaving a dead rule. 2G reuses the real per-BTS osmo-bsc admin-lock (`blockBtsByIdx`, extracted from the pre-existing single-BTS route so the new bulk `/bts/block-all` route can drive it) — genuinely different blast radius (drops camped UEs immediately, real device impact) than the other three's mild host-only nftables rules, so its button/copy are deliberately distinct rather than looking identical. **Building this feature's 2G path surfaced a real, long-standing bug — see the 2G GSM gotcha below.** | `radio-block-controller.ts`, `gnb-block-controller.ts`, `hnb-block-controller.ts`, `gsm-controller.ts` | `DashboardPage.tsx`, `RANPage.tsx` (same flash-red treatment extended to every individual per-radio Block/Unblock button) |

Full detail on any of these: `docs/features.md`.

## Reference facts

- **PLMN**: MCC 001, MNC 01 (`5gc.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org`,
  `epc.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org` — the two zones the DNS Migration Wizard
  manages; migrated off the original 999-070 test PLMN, confirmed live 2026-07-29 —
  older docs/memory referencing 999/070 are stale).
- **Radio IPs** (verify before trusting — deployments change):
  - `10.0.2.100–102` — Baicells eNB(s), B48, 4G/LTE
  - `10.0.2.214` — Nokia AirScale Pico BTS, B66, 4G/LTE
  - `172.16.0.117` — Sercomm SCE5164-B48 gNB, B48, 5G NR
  - EIGRP neighbor for the RAN-facing routes: `192.168.253.1` on `ens20`.
- **SAS bands**: Baicells B48 CBRS (group `baicells`, 3550–3700 MHz, 20 MHz slots),
  Sercomm B48 CBRS (group `SC_Group`, 3616–3655 MHz). Sercomm FCC IDs start `P27-`.
- **Backend port** 3001, **frontend** 8081 internally / nginx on 80 + 8888 externally,
  **SAS HTTPS** 8443, **Sercomm factory-default ACS relay** 443 (DNS-hijack trick, needs
  `acs.crt`/`acs.key` with `CN=acs.sc.sercomm.com` — see gotcha below).
- **Version**: `backend/package.json`/`frontend/package.json` version should match
  `CHANGELOG.md`'s top entry — keep them in sync when bumping.

## Known-fixed gotchas worth knowing about (so you don't reintroduce them)

- **nginx needs two self-signed certs to start at all** (`nginx/setup-sas-cert.sh`,
  run by the `cert-init` Docker service): `sas.crt`/`sas.key` (any hostname) and
  `acs.crt`/`acs.key` (must be `CN=acs.sc.sercomm.com` — hardcoded in `nginx.conf`'s
  `server_name`). Missing either one means nginx fails to start entirely (it loads
  every `conf.d/` server block up front) — found on a genuinely fresh install where
  only the `sas.crt` generator existed; `acs.crt` had only ever been created manually
  on the original dev host and nobody noticed the script never made it.
- **`.gitignore` must exclude runtime data**: `mongo_docker/`, `hlr.db*`, `sms.db`,
  `backend/radio-backups/` — these contain real subscriber keys/PII and are NOT
  meant to be committed. Already fixed once (2026-07-16) after nearly being swept
  into a commit via `git add -A`.
- **CIDR/IP-range math**: `backend/src/domain/services/ip-utils.ts`'s `cidrRange`/
  `cidrNetworkRange` had a real bug — any subnet with a first octet ≥128 (e.g.
  `192.168.x.x`) produced a corrupted signed 32-bit integer from an unmasked bitwise
  `&`, silently returning wrong ranges. Fixed by normalizing with `>>> 0` after the
  AND. If you add more IP-math helpers, watch for this exact class of bug — it's a
  classic JS bitwise-operator footgun (`&`/`|` operate on signed Int32).
- **jest wasn't actually installed** despite being in `backend/package.json`'s
  devDependencies — `npm test` was silently broken. If tests won't run, check
  `node_modules/.bin/jest` actually exists; `npm install` fixes it.
- **PyHSS's own `Answer_16777216_300`/`_302` (Cx UAA/LIA) could crash on a
  missing AVP** (`/opt/pyhss/lib/diameter.py`, a third-party file, not part of
  this repo): if the expected identity AVP was absent, an `IndexError` inside
  the `try` block left the id variable (`imsi`/`username`) unassigned, and the
  `except` handler's own Redis-metric label then referenced that same
  unassigned variable, raising a second, uncaught `UnboundLocalError` — the
  function died before writing either the success AVP or the proper
  `5001 Experimental-Result-Code`, which looked exactly like a "genuinely
  intermittent" Cx failure with no result code at all. Fixed live (2026-07-26)
  and baked into `POST /api/ims/install` in `ims-controller.ts` (same
  idempotent, exit-code-checked patch style as the `cdp.so` process-slot
  patch above it) — runs on every Install, so existing deployments just need
  to re-run Install to pick it up. See memory: `ims-pyhss-uaa-lia-crash-guard`.
- **PyHSS's `default_ifc.xml` could corrupt a subscriber's SIP identity to
  `sip:<msisdn>@None`** (`/opt/pyhss/default_ifc.xml`, a third-party file, not
  part of this repo): its `<PrivateID>`/`<Identity>` elements built the
  domain from `scscf_realm`, a DB column `database.py`'s
  `Update_Serving_CSCF()` explicitly nulls on every deregister — a
  deregister/re-register race could bake the literal string `"None"` into
  the subscriber's Implicit Registration Set, cached by S-CSCF until the
  next re-register. Looked exactly like a client-side phone bug (previously
  "fixed" by toggling Airplane Mode) — it wasn't. Fixed by deriving the
  domain from `mnc`/`mcc` instead (always fresh, never touched by the
  dereg-clearing bug). Fixed live (2026-07-27) and baked into
  `POST /api/ims/install` the same way as the two bugs above. See memory:
  `ims-pyhss-none-domain-corruption`.
- **Phantom `nms-*` classes/tokens silently render unstyled — Tailwind doesn't
  error on an undefined custom class, it just generates nothing.** Found live
  (2026-08-14): `nms-btn-secondary` was used on 5 buttons across the frontend
  but was never defined in `index.css` (only `nms-btn-primary`/`nms-btn-danger`/
  `nms-btn-ghost` exist) — every button using it rendered with zero color/box
  styling. A full audit turned up the same class of bug three more times:
  `nms-accent-hover`/`nms-surface-1`/`nms-text-secondary` used as Tailwind
  color tokens in 20+ places but never defined in `tailwind.config.js`'s
  `colors`, and `nms-checkbox` used on 11+ checkboxes with no CSS rule at all.
  If you add a new `nms-*`-prefixed class or color token, grep both
  `index.css` and `tailwind.config.js` first to confirm it actually exists.
- **A static IMS Kamailio template (`kamailio_scscf.cfg`/`pcscf.cfg`/etc.) only
  reaches the live host via `deployImsTemplate()`, which only runs inside a
  full IMS Install/Configure — none of the lightweight per-feature toggle
  setters (`setSmsDeliveryMode()`, `setVoiceChargingEnabled()`,
  `setCdrAccountingEnabled()`, etc.) ever call it.** Those setters only
  rewrite the small *generated* include file (`scscf.cfg`) and restart the
  one affected service — editing the static template source in this repo and
  then just flipping a toggle does NOT redeploy your edit. Found live
  2026-09-17 wiring CDR Phase 3: `kamailio_scscf.cfg`'s live host copy was
  stale by a full day, missing both that day's earlier Ro/voice-charging
  origin-host fix AND the new WITH_CDR blocks — `setCdrAccountingEnabled(true)`
  restarted `kamailio-scscf` and reported success, but the running config
  still had no `acc` module loaded at all, since only the *generated*
  `scscf.cfg` had been rewritten. If you edit a static IMS template's source
  and need it live without a full re-Configure, redeploy that one file
  manually (copy the built `dist/config/ims-templates/.../*.cfg` to its real
  host path) before restarting the service — don't assume any toggle setter
  did it for you.
- **The 2G BTS Block/Unblock feature (`gsm-controller.ts`) never actually
  worked, since the day it was first built — a background osmo-bsc
  reconciliation loop silently overrode it every time, with zero error
  anywhere.** Only discovered 2026-09-21 because the RAN Kill Switches
  Dashboard feature finally gave this route its first-ever real UI trigger.
  The original command, `change-adm-state locked` sent at the `(oml)`
  pseudo-node (targeting NM object class "bts" directly), is accepted with
  zero VTY error and zero journalctl error — but osmo-bsc's own
  `nm_bts_fsm.c`'s `configure_loop()` runs a background reconciliation that
  silently re-unlocks any "bts"-class object it considers should be in
  service, with no guard against a manual lock at that level. Confirmed live
  by locking, then re-reading `show bts N` immediately and repeatedly over
  8+ seconds — Admin state never left 'Unlocked', and the OML Link's own
  uptime counter never reset either (ruling out a reconnect race, not just a
  timing issue). Root-caused by reading osmo-bsc 1.9.0's real source
  (`apt-get source osmo-bsc`, not guessed) — `rf_locked (0|1)`, a
  config-tree command on the TRX object specifically (`configure terminal`
  → `network` → `bts N` → `trx N`), is the real, sticky mechanism: it sets
  `trx->mo.force_rf_lock`, the one guard the equivalent TRX-level
  reconciliation loop in `nm_rcarrier_fsm.c` DOES check before
  auto-re-unlocking. Fixed in both `blockBtsByIdx` (the interactive route)
  and `reapplyBtsLocks()` (the restart-recovery counterpart, which means
  **this also silently never worked for the entire time the 2G module has
  existed** — any BTS marked `blocked` never actually came back locked
  after an osmo-bsc restart). The verify query also had to change: `show
  bts N` has no per-TRX NM State line at all — `show trx N 0` is what
  prints the TRX's own "Radio Carrier NM State", which
  `parseBtsLinkStatus`'s existing regex still matches unmodified. If you
  ever add another osmo-bsc administrative-state action, don't assume
  `change-adm-state` at a low-level NM pseudo-node actually sticks for
  every object class — check whether that class's own FSM has a
  `configure_loop()`-style reconciliation loop first, and whether a
  dedicated `force_rf_lock`-style config-tree command already exists for
  it.

## User / workflow conventions

- **Never include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any AI attribution) in git commits.**
  User has explicitly said this multiple times.
- **Always rebuild AND restart the frontend container after any frontend file
  change** — `docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d frontend`. Vite
  builds are static; source changes do nothing until rebuilt. Same for backend.
- **Never factory-reset, wipe, or perform any other destructive action on a radio or
  device without explicit confirmation first** — this destroys all device config and
  requires full re-provisioning. Stop and ask before queuing anything like this.
- **UI layout convention (standard as of 2026-08-16 — apply to every new page)**:
  outer wrapper `p-6 space-y-6`; header is `flex items-center justify-between
  flex-wrap gap-3` with a title (`h1.text-2xl.font-semibold.font-display`) +
  subtitle (`p.text-sm.text-nms-text-dim.mt-1`) block on the left, and — for any
  page that owns a module lifecycle (install/configure/start/stop/restart) —
  status badges + action buttons on the right (never buried in a body card).
  When a page has more than one logical section, use a **centered pill-style
  tab bar**: `flex justify-center` wrapping `flex gap-1 p-1 bg-nms-surface-2
  rounded-lg border border-nms-border`, each tab `flex items-center gap-2 px-4
  py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-all` with an icon, active
  `bg-nms-accent text-white shadow-sm` / inactive `text-nms-text-dim
  hover:text-nms-text hover:bg-nms-surface` — not the older left-aligned
  underline-tab style. Full-width cards throughout (no `max-w`/centering
  wrappers on card content itself). Reference implementations: `AutoConfigPage.
  tsx`, `SecGWPage.tsx`, `VoWiFiPage.tsx`, `IMSPage.tsx`, `PstnGatewayPage.tsx`,
  `FRRPage.tsx`, `SASPage.tsx`, `MetricsPage.tsx`. Gotcha: gate header
  service-control visibility on "is this module installed" (`installedOnDisk`/
  `installed`), never on "is it fully configured" — a real bug (VoWiFi's Start/
  Stop/Restart buttons vanishing while the service was actively running,
  because they were gated on `configured` instead) came from getting this
  wrong. Full rationale and a per-page shape breakdown: PROJECT_STATE.md's
  Engineering Decision Log, "centered pill-style tab nav + header-mounted
  service control" entry.
- **Only commit when explicitly asked.** This project has gone through periods of
  large uncommitted work by design (user wanted a clean-host test before committing) —
  don't assume "the fix works" means "commit it."
- **Verify, don't trust "success."** A use-case returning `{success: true}` doesn't
  mean every sub-step actually worked (seen with `applyPhaseC` reporting success while
  one of 11 NF restarts had actually crashed) — always independently check
  `systemctl is-active`/`journalctl` after any apply/restart/migrate action before
  reporting it as done.

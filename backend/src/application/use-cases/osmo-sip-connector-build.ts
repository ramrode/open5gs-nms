// target (see osmoSipConnectorCfg() below), not baked in here.
//
// The ONE patch this build DOES carry (BUILD_REV 2, added 2026-09-21) is
// unrelated to routing/audio-codec content — it's a real, confirmed-live
// signaling-timeout bug: mncc.c's start_cmd_timer() hardcodes a 5s window
// for every "wait for the next expected MNCC message" case it's used for,
// including MNCC_SETUP_COMPL_IND — the *originating* leg's own confirmation
// that its UE received CONNECT and sent back CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGE, after the
// callee has already answered. That's a real over-the-air round trip
// (UE<->BTS<->BSC<->MSC), and 5s isn't consistently enough for it under
// normal GSM scheduling/retransmission timing — confirmed live 2026-09-21
// via a full capture session: the exact same caller/callee pair on a native
// 2G-to-2G short-code call succeeded on one attempt and failed the next,
// every failure showing this exact timer expiring
// (`command(0x106) never arrived for leg(...)`) moments after both legs had
// already been marked connected, tearing down a call that was otherwise
// completely healthy. SIPCONN_SETUP_COMPL_TIMEOUT_PATCH below widens ONLY
// that one call site to 15s via a new start_cmd_timer_t() helper — every
// other start_cmd_timer() caller (RTP_CREATE, REL_CNF, REL_IND) keeps the
// original 5s, deliberately not touched since they weren't implicated.

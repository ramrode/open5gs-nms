## ✨ Key Features

### Authentication
- **Login required** — All pages and API endpoints are protected. A login form is shown automatically to unauthenticated users
- **Session persistence** — Sessions survive page refresh (24-hour lifetime by default, configurable)
- **Secure cookies** — HttpOnly, SameSite=lax; `Secure` flag enabled when behind HTTPS
- **First-run setup** — Admin account created automatically on first deploy (see [First Login](#first-login))
- **Brute force protection** — Login endpoint rate-limited to 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP

### Metrics & Monitoring
- **Prometheus Integration** — Prometheus scrape config auto-generated and live-reloaded on every config apply. No manual `prometheus.yml` editing needed
- **Grafana Dashboards** — Pre-built Open5GS dashboard covering AMF, SMF, UPF, PCF, HSS, PCRF and process health. Grafana datasource auto-provisioned on first start
- **Metrics Endpoints Page** — Dual-mode editor: table view for individual NF address/port editing, or direct Prometheus scrape config YAML editing. Both views stay in sync
- **One-click access** — Prometheus and Grafana links directly in the Metrics page header

![Prometheus Targets](docs/screenshots/metrics-prometheus-targets.png)

### Traffic History
- **GTP U-Plane throughput over time** — aggregate across all subscribers per DNN, or filtered down to a single subscriber
- **Configurable resolution** — 5 minute, 15 minute, or 1 hour buckets, plus a flexible time-range picker
- **Live latest-rate readout** — current Up/Down Mbps shown alongside the chart
- **Built on the existing Prometheus, not a second time-series store** — reuses the already-deployed Prometheus stack's own `rate()` computation over raw cumulative byte counters exposed by the backend's own `/metrics` endpoint, so retention matches whatever Prometheus is already configured for
- An earlier version of this feature built its own MongoDB-backed time-series store for this data; it was replaced once it became clear Prometheus was already deployed and already doing the job

![Traffic History](docs/screenshots/traffic-history.png)

### SNMP Monitoring
- **Read-only Net-SNMP agent** — installs and manages `snmpd` from the NMS for PRTG and other SNMP managers
- **Host + mobile-core scalars** — CPU/memory utilization, connected 4G/5G UE counts, connected eNodeB/gNodeB counts, `ogstun` operational state and byte counters, active Open5GS service count
- **Standard `IF-MIB` interface data** — every host interface (including `ogstun`) readable through standard SNMP interface sensors, no custom MIB required for that part
- **Downloadable experimental MIB** — `OPEN5GS-NMS-MIB.txt` generated and served directly from the page for the Open5GS-specific scalars
- **Restricted by design** — SNMPv2c community + CIDR-restricted read-only access, configured at install time
- Opt-in module — off by default (`ENABLE_SNMP_MODULE=false` in `.env`); enable and rebuild the frontend to show it in the nav

*(Screenshots coming soon)*

### Configuration Management
- **Dual Editor Modes** - Form-based editor with 150+ contextual tooltips OR Monaco YAML editor
- **All 17 Network Functions** - Complete coverage: NRF, SCP, AMF, SMF, UPF, AUSF, UDM, UDR, PCF, NSSF, BSF, SEPP (5G) + MME, HSS, PCRF, SGW-C, SGW-U (4G)
- **Real-Time Validation** - Zod schema validation with cross-service dependency checking
- **Safe Apply Workflow** - Automatic backups, ordered service restarts, automatic rollback on failure
- **YAML Preservation** - Maintains comments, formatting, and structure

![AMF Configuration Editor](docs/screenshots/config-amf-editor.png)

### RAN Network Monitoring
- **4G EPC section** — S1-MME (control plane) and S1-U (user plane) interface cards with live connected eNodeB IPs
- **5G NR section** — N2 (AMF ↔ gNodeB) and N3 (UPF ↔ gNodeB) interface cards with live connected gNodeB IPs
- **UE-to-radio mapping** — each radio card shows which UEs are connected to it (IMSI, UE IP, CM State) nested directly under the radio row
- **Active UE Sessions table** — combined 4G + 5G sessions with Generation, CM State, DNN/APN, Security algorithms, AMBR, and Radio IP columns
- **True 4G/5G separation** — sourced directly from Open5GS internal APIs (AMF, MME, SMF) — no packet capture needed
- All interface IPs sourced from Open5GS YAML configs — no hardcoded addresses

![RAN Network Page](docs/screenshots/ran-network-page.png)

### UE Signal Quality
- **Per-UE radio measurements** — RSRP/RSRQ/SINR/BLER/MCS/CQI/throughput correlated with subscriber identity (IMSI/ICCID/MSISDN)
- **Baicells-native today** — built-in connector for Baicells radios; other vendors need the generic JSON connector, which requires the radio to expose its own metrics in that shape, so it isn't a drop-in for every vendor
- **Encrypted credential storage** — radio credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM on the server, never returned by the API
- **7-day signal history** — SQLite-backed per-UE history, viewable as an RSRP/SINR trend chart
- **Downlink wake packets** — admin-triggered wake for idle UEs to force a fresh measurement when core identity (IMSI/ICCID/MSISDN) hasn't yet correlated
- Opt-in module — off by default (`ENABLE_UE_SIGNAL_MODULE=false` in `.env`); enable and rebuild the frontend to show it in the nav

![UE Signal Overview](docs/screenshots/ue-signal-overview.png)

![UE Signal Add Radio](docs/screenshots/ue-signal-add-radio.png)

### Network Topology Visualization
- **Interactive Diagram** - JointJS-based professional network topology
- **Real-Time Status** - Color-coded service indicators (green=active, red=inactive)
- **5G Radio Network Status box** — live N2 and N3 gNodeB IPs on the topology canvas
- **Active 5G UE Sessions box** — UE IP + IMSI pairs sourced from Open5GS AMF/SMF APIs
- **Active 4G UE Sessions box** — UE IP + IMSI pairs sourced from Open5GS MME API
- **Professional Layout** - Manual routing with 90-degree orthogonal connectors

![Network Topology Visualization](docs/screenshots/topology-network-diagram.png)

### Service Management
- **Real-Time Monitoring** — WebSocket-based live status cards for all 17 NFs plus MongoDB
- **Systemd Integration** — Start, stop, restart, enable and disable services directly from the UI
- **Bulk Operations** — Control all services at once in correct dependency order
- **MongoDB tracking** — MongoDB included as a first-class service with status indicator on topology

![Service Management](docs/screenshots/service-management.png)

### Auto-Configuration Wizard
- **One-Click Setup** — Generate all 17 NF configurations from minimal input (PLMN, host IPs, UE subnets)
- **Preview Changes** — YAML diff viewer shows exact changes before applying
- **Persistent NAT** — iptables rules saved via `netfilter-persistent` and IP forwarding via `sysctl.d` — survive reboots

![Auto-Configuration Wizard](docs/screenshots/auto-config-wizard.png)

### Backup & Restore
- **Automatic Backups** — Created before every configuration change; configurable retention policy
- **Selective Restore** — Restore config only, database only, both, or specific NFs
- **Rollback Protection** — Automatic restore on service restart failure
- **Diff Viewer** — Compare any backup against current config before restoring
- **Factory Defaults** — One-click restore to stock Open5GS configuration

![Backup & Restore](docs/screenshots/backup-restore.png)

![Backup & Restore Modal](docs/screenshots/backup-restore-modal.png)

### Femtocell Provisioning (Sercomm SCE4255W)
- **Auto-credential derivation** — derives root SSH and WebUI passwords from MAC address using the calc_f2 algorithm
- **Auto-config pull** — detects if WebUI is already enabled and pulls current config into the form automatically
- **Full provisioning** — enables WebUI via SSH if needed, applies all radio and core config, reboots device
- **CBRS Band 48 defaults** — pre-filled for dual-carrier deployment
- **MME IP auto-populated** from your Open5GS configuration
- **Browser geolocation** for SAS lat/long coordinates

![Femtocell Config Loaded](docs/screenshots/femto-config-loaded.png)

### CBRS SAS Server (Citizens Broadband Radio Service)
- **Built-in SAS** — Lab-only SAS-CBSD protocol emulator for controlled testing. Not an FCC-approved SAS and not suitable for live CBRS authorization. For live CBRS operation, CBSDs must obtain grants from an FCC-approved SAS Administrator.
- **Multi-radio support** — deterministic per-CBSD channel assignment based on serial number sort order; race-condition-proof, survives re-registrations and Clear DB cycles
- **Interference coordination groups** — radios in the same group are automatically spread across non-overlapping 20 MHz slots
- **Multi-band support** — configure multiple frequency bands to serve different radio types (e.g. Baicells on 3560–3620 MHz, Sercomm on 3649–3700 MHz)
- **Band Assignment** — three-level band policy: per-CBSD override > interference group assignment > global default; pins specific radios or entire groups to specific frequency ranges
- **Unified spectrum view** — all radios and bands shown on a single 3550–3700 MHz plot alongside per-band detail charts
- **Multi-site scaling** — independent slot assignment per interference group; two sites can reuse the same frequencies without conflict
- **Spectrum chart** — visual frequency band display with color-coded slots, EARFCN labels, and per-CBSD assignment table
- **GPS delay enforcement** — configurable lock delay (default 75 s) before grants are issued, ensuring radios are GPS-locked before transmitting
- **Pause / Resume** — instantly stops all SAS responses (radios return DEREGISTER and go silent) without deleting any data
- **Clear DB** — wipes all grants and CBSDs in one click for testing; radios re-register and get fresh deterministic slot assignments on reboot
- **CBRS SAS protocol** — implements the WInnForum CBRS SAS-CBSD interface (registration, spectrumInquiry, grant, heartbeat, relinquishment, deregistration)
- **HTTPS SAS endpoint** — TLS endpoint on port 8443 with auto-generated self-signed certificate; required for Sercomm radios which mandate HTTPS
- **Sercomm SCE4255W full integration** — complete SAS parameter provisioning via GenieACS TR-069 including Method, Category, ChannelType, HeightType, ManufacturerPrefix, CPI settings, lat/long in microdegrees
- **Baicells TR-069 integration** — full SAS parameter provisioning via GenieACS ACS on the Baicells provisioning page
- **Quiet docker logs** — per-request SAS protocol noise suppressed; clean 30-second status summary printed to docker compose logs instead

- **GenieACS TR-069 ACS integration** — radios register automatically via CWMP on port 7547
- **Live RF status** — per-radio status dot (green = RF on, amber = RF off, red = offline) with 30-second auto-refresh
- **Full config push** — all parameters sent in a single TR-069 session, followed by automatic reboot and RF enable
- **Editable confirm modal** — preview the exact GenieACS NBI API calls before anything is sent; edit the JSON if needed
- **Per-radio and global controls** — Enable RF, Disable RF, Reboot per radio; RF On All, RF Off All, Reboot All from the header
- **Auto-backup** — full device parameter snapshot saved to disk after every successful provision
- **Audit logging** — all provision, reboot, and RF actions logged
- **Tested on:** Baicells Nova 430i running BaiBLQ_3.0.12 firmware

### Sercomm 5G NR Provisioning (SCE5164-B48) *(Beta)*
- **Dedicated "Sercomm 5G" tab** in the Auto-Config page, alongside Open5GS/Femto(4G)/Baicells
- **Full CU/DU split provisioning** — gNB identity, NG/F1 interface addressing, cell config (PLMN, TAC, PCI, S-NSSAI), and TDD slot pattern configuration in one push
- **SAS integration** — CBRS parameters (FCC ID, category, GPS location, band) provisioned alongside the radio config
- **Tested on:** Sercomm SCE5164-B48 running RC5607@230707 firmware

![Sercomm 5G NR Provisioning](docs/screenshots/sercomm-nr-provisioning.png)

### Security Gateway (SecGW) *(Alpha — Experimental)*

> ⚠️ **This module is in alpha.** Real IPsec tunnels are confirmed working end-to-end for both Baicells and Nokia radios simultaneously — real S1AP/GTP-U traffic verified flowing through the tunnel via packet capture (ESP wrapper + decrypted SCTP heartbeat, correlated by timestamp). Per-radio IPsec configuration on the radio's own page is manual — there is no automatic TR-069 push in this version.

- **Terminates IPsec from real RAN backhaul** — decrypts S1-MME/S1-U (4G) and N2/N3 (5G) traffic at the edge and forwards it in plaintext to the existing core NFs, the same "decrypt at the edge" pattern this project's VoWiFi ePDG already uses. Built on strongSwan/`swanctl`, source-built with a small patch so it coexists with VoWiFi's own IKEv2 daemon on the same host
- **Vendor-aware Radios tab** — separate Baicells and Nokia sub-tabs, since the two vendors' IPsec models are fundamentally different: Baicells negotiates a virtual IP dynamically via IKEv2 Configuration Payload, while Nokia has no CP support at all and instead uses static tunnel endpoints plus one or more explicit "Protect" traffic-selector policies
- **Per-radio dedicated pool addresses** — every radio gets its own unique address, never a shared range, avoiding kernel XFRM policy collisions between radios
- **Additional Protected Destinations** — extend a radio's tunnel to reach more than the core NF pair (e.g. the internal BIND DNS server), for radios whose own IPsec page can't do a plaintext bypass for that traffic
- **Full connection-info sheet per radio** — downloadable bundle (cert/PSK plus a plain-language cheat sheet) with the exact values to enter on the radio's own IPsec page, using that vendor's own field names and terminology
- **Live Sessions view** — real-time IKE/CHILD SA status, traffic selectors, and byte counters per radio, parsed straight from `swanctl --list-sas`
- **Additive by design** — adding a radio never touches its existing plaintext path; the operator manually re-points the radio at the gateway only after verifying the tunnel with the built-in Test Tunnel button
- `ENABLE_SECGW_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in)

- **Keypair Generation** — Create X25519 (Profile A) or secp256r1 (Profile B) home network keys
- **Public Key Display** — Hex format ready for eSIM provisioning
- **pySIM JSON Generator** — One-click generation of correctly formatted `EF.SUCI_Calc_Info` JSON for pySIM-shell, in both pretty and single-line formats
- **Automatic Configuration** — Updates UDM config with new public key on generate/rotate
- **PKI Management** — Support for multiple PKI values (0–255) with next-ID auto-suggestion, rename without destroying keys

![Generate Key Modal](docs/screenshots/suci-generate-key-modal.png)

![pySIM JSON Generator](docs/screenshots/suci-pysim-json.png)

### Subscriber Management
- **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, delete subscribers via MongoDB
- **SIM Generator** - Generate test SIM credentials with country-based MCC selection (65+ countries)
- **Auto-Provisioning** - Automatically add generated SIMs to Open5GS database
- **Multi-Slice Support** - Configure multiple network slices and sessions per subscriber
- **Search & Pagination** - Efficient browsing of large subscriber databases
- **Subscriber Groups** — organize subscribers into named, colored groups (e.g. "Field trial A", "Test devices") for easier browsing of large deployments
- **Framed Routing** — configure IPv4/IPv6 subnets routed behind a UE per session (TS 23.501 §5.6.14, e.g. an IoT gateway's LAN); optional one-click static host route management, non-blocking overlap/duplicate warnings against other subscribers and the core UE pool, and a Framed Routes Registry view listing every configured subnet across all subscribers

![Subscriber Groups](docs/screenshots/subscriber-groups.png)

![SIM Generator](docs/screenshots/sim-generator-dialog.png)

### Time Server (NTP via Chrony)
- **Chrony integration** — manages Chrony NTP daemon directly from the NMS; start, stop, restart, and configure without touching the CLI
- **Live tracking status** — reference server, stratum, system offset, RMS offset, frequency, root delay, update interval, and leap status all shown live
- **NTP server & pool management** — add, remove, and reorder upstream servers and pools with iburst/noselect flags
- **Allowed client networks** — configure which subnets can query the NTP server (critical for radios and UEs)
- **Advanced options** — makestep, maxdistance, and other Chrony directives exposed in the UI
- **Save & Restart** — writes `chrony.conf` and restarts the daemon in one click

![Time Server](docs/screenshots/screenshot-time-server.png)

### FRR / L3 Routing
- **Layer 2 → Layer 3 migration wizard** — step-by-step guided migration from flat L2 service IPs to routed L3 using FRR + Virtual Service Interfaces (VSIs)
- **Multi-protocol support** — EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP; each protocol generates correct FRR config with appropriate neighbor/peer setup
- **Live Routing Status** — real-time neighbor status, EIGRP/OSPF/BGP topology table showing all prefixes, next-hops, interfaces, and metrics
- **Route Filters** — outbound and inbound prefix-list based filtering with Auto VSI filter button, preview, apply, and rollback
- **Active Configuration** — read-only summary of protocol, AS number, peer IP, and VSI mappings once migration is complete
- **Pre-flight checklist** — built-in requirements guide covering the 3 required interfaces, router-side prerequisites, and known FRR 8.4.x EIGRP limitations
- **Full rollback** — backup taken before any changes; rollback button restores previous state at any phase
- **Reinstall (Source)** — migrates FRR from the Ubuntu apt package (8.4.4, has long-standing eigrpd assertion-crash bugs) to a from-source build, with automatic backup, build, config-restore, and rollback
- **FRR log-level selector** — dropdown for FRR's 8 syslog severities (emergencies…debugging), applied via `vtysh -b` reload with no neighbor flap
- **TUN Interfaces & Dummy Interfaces** — now sub-tabs of this page (grouped alongside routing), instead of separate top-level nav items. TUN interfaces persist across reboots via systemd-networkd `.netdev`/`.network` files

![FRR / L3 Routing — Reinstall from Source](docs/screenshots/frr-source-build.png)

### SEPP / 5G Roaming (N32)
- **17th core NF** — SEPP (`open5gs-seppd`) gets its own Config tab alongside the other 16 NFs, included in the standard bulk Apply Config / backup / restart flow
- **Home SEPP configuration** — SBI server/client, N32-c and N32-f identity, scheme, address, and port
- **Optional TLS/mutual-TLS on N32** — toggle between plaintext HTTP and TLS; "Generate Certs" creates a self-signed keypair for your home SEPP and displays the public cert for handing to a visited-network operator; paste their public cert back in as the trusted peer CA
- **Generate Visited PLMN Config** — builds a complete, downloadable `sepp.yaml` for the visited operator from your already-configured home SEPP values, including your public cert when TLS is enabled

![SEPP Configuration](docs/screenshots/sepp-config.png)

### DNS (BIND9) / FQDN Migration Wizard
- **BIND9 zone management** — dedicated "DNS (BIND9)" page for managing the DNS server backing your core's internal domain resolution
- **FQDN migration wizard** — converts the entire core from hardcoded IP addressing to 3GPP FQDN/DNS addressing (`5gc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org` for SBI, `epc.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.3gppnetwork.org` for the EPC Diameter mesh), matching carrier-grade deployment conventions and Open5GS's own roaming tutorial
- **Phased, reversible** — Phase A (DNS zones only), Phase B (EPC/Diameter mesh), Phase C (5G SBI mesh); a fresh backup is taken before B/C and rollback stays available as long as it exists
- **SEPP-aware** — includes SEPP's local SBI client in the FQDN scheme (its N32 peer to the visited PLMN is deliberately excluded — that's a different operator's DNS, not something local zone management can resolve)

![DNS / FQDN Migration Wizard](docs/screenshots/dns-migration-wizard.png)

### Real-Time Logging
- **Four log sources** — Open5GS systemd services, Docker containers, GenieACS access logs, and FRR, all streamed live via WebSocket
- **Live Log Streaming** — Tail logs from any service, with multi-select service/container filtering
- **Major Events view** — a filtered timeline of just the meaningful transitions (radio connect/disconnect, 4G attach/detach, 5G register/deregister, PDU session up/down) instead of raw DEBUG noise, across all 16 NF streams at once. Filter by event type, radio, and IMSI; click any event to open a zoomable log-context viewer showing the surrounding raw lines
- **Syslog Forwarding** — forwards all Open5GS, GenieACS, and FRR logs to a remote syslog server (e.g. Graylog) via rsyslog. Detects/installs rsyslog automatically, writes a dedicated drop-in config that never touches your existing rsyslog setup, and self-heals the AppArmor and file-permission issues that otherwise silently block it
- **Log Download & Debug Bundle** — download raw logs by service/date range, or a one-click debug bundle for bug reports

![Log Viewer](docs/screenshots/logs-viewer.png)

![Major Events Log View](docs/screenshots/major-events-view.png)

![Syslog Forwarding](docs/screenshots/syslog-forwarding-modal.png)

### IMS / VoLTE

- **Full IMS core integration** — P-CSCF/I-CSCF/S-CSCF (Kamailio 5.8.8, built with IMS/TLS/MySQL/extra modules), PyHSS Diameter HSS, BIND9 DNS, RTPEngine, MariaDB
- **One-click install** of every IMS component, including PyHSS ([nickvsnetworking/pyhss](https://github.com/nickvsnetworking/pyhss)), cloned and set up automatically — no separate manual install required
- **Guided configuration** — wires the P-CSCF address into SMF's PCO and per-session DNS, writes the Cx/Rx Diameter peer XML, and generates the IMS DNS zone automatically
- **Subscriber sync** — pushes IMPI/IMPU identities for your existing subscribers into PyHSS's HSS database
- **Real-phone VoLTE confirmed** — real, registered iPhones and Android phones calling each other rings and connects with full audio, including a real P-CSCF↔PCRF Rx interface for dedicated QCI=1 bearers, on PLMN 001-01

![IMS Configuration](docs/screenshots/ims-config.png)

### SMS over SGs *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **SMS over IMS (part of the IMS/VoLTE module above) is the default, primary SMS path and is stable** — real phones prefer it whenever IMS-registered anyway. This module is an opt-in, experimental alternative for deployments without IMS. Real two-UE SGs delivery has an open, unresolved bug (P-CSCF failing to relay a locally-generated reply back through the IPsec tunnel) — test carefully before relying on SGs delivery mode for real subscriber SMS.

- **Osmocom CS-fallback SMS stack** — `osmo-stp` + `osmo-hlr` + `osmo-msc`, connected to the MME via the SGs interface, for SMS delivery without any IMS/VoLTE deployment
- **One-click install** — packages, service lifecycle (start/stop/restart/enable/disable), and subscriber sync all from the UI
- **Config file editor** — Monaco-based editor for all three Osmocom `.cfg` files with per-file save and save-and-restart
- **Architecture panel** — built-in diagram explaining how SMS over SGsAP works, right on the page
- Requires a combined EPS/IMSI attach from the UE

![SMS over SGs](docs/screenshots/sms-config.png)

### MMS *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **This module is in beta.** Real end-to-end MMS confirmed working on a real UE. `ENABLE_MMS_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in).

- **VectorCore MMSC** ([vectorcore-mobile](https://github.com/vectorcore-mobile)) — built from source (Go toolchain + embedded web UI) and installed as a host service with one click; delivery notifications ride on the existing SMS (SGs) SMPP interface, so IMS/SMS must already be configured
- **Direct links to VectorCore's own admin UI and JSON API** — this page doesn't reimplement them, it links straight out
- **Subscriber sync** — pushes MSISDNs from the Open5GS MongoDB into VectorCore so it knows which numbers can send/receive MMS
- **iPhone MMS Settings Profile generator** — iOS hides the manual APN/MMSC settings screen on most SIMs; generates a ready-to-install `.mobileconfig` with the correct MMSC URL pre-filled
- **Real upstream bugs found and patched** — VectorCore's MM1 request-path logging defaulted too quiet to diagnose delivery issues, and real phones send MMS PDUs with no usable `From` field; fixed with a small compiled-Go reverse proxy (`mm1-msisdn-proxy.go`, its own systemd unit, built during every Configure) that resolves the sender's MSISDN from the UE's Framed-Routing IP and injects the `X-MSISDN` header VectorCore expects
- Lives as a second tab on the SMS/MMS page, not a separate nav entry

![MMS Setup](docs/screenshots/mms-setup.png)

![MMS iPhone Settings Profile](docs/screenshots/mms-iphone-profile.png)

### VoWiFi *(Alpha — Experimental)*

> ⚠️ **This module is in alpha.** Real SIP signaling over VoWiFi is confirmed working end-to-end on a real phone — full IKEv2/EAP-AKA' attach, a real REGISTER → 401 Challenge → REGISTER → 200 OK → SUBSCRIBE → NOTIFY exchange, and a real iPhone-to-iPhone call with two-way audio. VoWiFi-to-VoLTE calling still has an open issue (connects with audio, drops after a few seconds). Do not rely on this for a production voice deployment yet.

- **VectorCore ePDG + VectorCore AAA** ([vectorcore-mobile](https://github.com/vectorcore-mobile)) — a native Go/eBPF ePDG (XDP/TC-BPF GTP-U dataplane) paired with an Erlang Diameter AAA stack (SWx to the HSS, SWm relay from the ePDG, S6b to the SMF), built from source and installed with one click
- **Config file editor** — Monaco-based editor for `epdg.yaml`/`aaa.config` with save and save-and-restart
- **Live Sessions page** — real-time client list (IMSI, UE IP, outer IP, APN, state) plus aggregate Clients/IKE SAs/Child SAs/Bearers counters, proxied straight from VectorCore ePDG's own admin API
- **Automatic staleness detection** — separate "reinstall available" and "reconfigure available" banners track vendored source patches and generated-config drift independently, so a deployment never silently runs stale patches after an update
- **Real upstream bugs found and patched** — including a same-host uplink GTP-U delivery bug (VectorCore's TC-BPF dataplane assumed a remote, ARP-resolvable PGW; fixed with a userspace ringbuf delivery path for the always-colocated case this project uses) and a half-open IKE SA reaper leak — both patched automatically during the vendored source build, not just live on one host

### UE Validation
- **Simulated test UEs** — spin up a 4G (srsRAN) or 5G (UERANSIM) test UE against your live core, no physical radio needed
- **End-to-end validation** — confirms attach, PDU session establishment, and idle-mode paging/wake all the way down to actual bidirectional traffic
- **Live log tailing & raw log download**, with session state that survives an NMS backend restart
- **Known limitation** — 5G idle-mode paging is unconfirmed (UERANSIM's simulated gNB may not implement an inactivity timer the way a real eNB does); 4G is fully verified end-to-end, 5G connected-state reachability is fully verified

### PSTN / Voice Gateway

> ⚠️ **No public SIP trunk provider connected yet** — the external trunk + inbound DID mapping mechanism itself is built and live-verified, but real provider connectivity (Twilio, Telnyx, or similar) is deliberately not configured on this deployment, since there's nothing to connect to. `ENABLE_PSTN_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in) — unlike most optional modules, which default enabled.

- **Wires Asterisk into S-CSCF's own PSTN dispatcher** for internal extension-to-subscriber calling, confirmed working end-to-end on real hardware (iPhone↔iPhone, iPhone↔Android) with full-duplex audio
- **Every subscriber's own real MSISDN is internally dialable**, auto-routed to IMS or 2G by their own `gsmEnabled` flag, alongside their existing extension short codes
- **Optional external SIP trunk + inbound DID mapping** — a real, off-host-reachable transport and firewall allowlist, all 4 buildable phases shipped, real provider connection deliberately not yet configured
- **Cross-RAN Calling** — one toggle peers this instance with Asterisk-2G, bridging 4G/5G and 2G short codes across both Asterisk instances with real AMR/AMR-WB↔GSM-FR transcoding, confirmed live with real over-the-air calls in both directions

### 2G GSM (Osmocom) *(Alpha)*

> ⚠️ **Real radio module.** Real spectrum transmission on real GSM hardware is a bigger blast radius than a broken lab feature — `ENABLE_GSM_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in).

- **Real GSM radio access** (osmo-bsc/osmo-bts) on real nanoBTS hardware confirmed on-air — CS attach/ciphering, GPRS/EDGE packet data, and 2G↔4G SMS are all **stable**
- **Real voice calling** needs a second, fully isolated Asterisk instance (Asterisk-2G) — osmo-msc's own built-in call handler can complete signaling but never implements real RTP audio (an upstream Osmocom limitation, not fixable in this project)
- One button installs, configures, and wires everything needed for 2G↔2G voice with real audio
- If a real call ever fails at channel assignment, it is **not necessarily a hardware problem** — a real `codec-support`/AMR configuration mismatch caused exactly this symptom once and had been misdiagnosed as unfixable hardware the day before

### 3G UMTS (OsmoHNBGW) *(Alpha)*

> ⚠️ Real femtocell hardware target. `ENABLE_HNBGW_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in).

- **Home NodeB Gateway** bridging a 3G femtocell's Iuh interface to the existing 2G-era osmo-msc/osmo-sgsn core over the already-running SS7 (`osmo-stp`) — no changes needed to either of those, confirmed live
- Reuses the 2G module's existing subscriber provisioning — no new credential setup needed for a subscriber to also work on 3G
- A software test HNB (OsmoHNodeB) is deployable from the module's own page — proved a full live registration end-to-end before any real 3G hardware was ever touched
- Real hardware target: an ip.access nano3G, which self-registers once pointed at this gateway (no remote-provisioning push, unlike 2G's OML)

### RF Planning *(Alpha)*

> ⚠️ **Early and actively being built out.** Expect incomplete phases and possible breaking changes between releases.

- **Deterministic LTE link-budget / site-geometry engine** — Phase 1 of a planned multi-phase tool
- Not yet a full replacement for a commercial planning suite — treat outputs as a starting point, not a final design
- `ENABLE_RF_PLANNING_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in)

### IP Plan Tool *(Beta)*

- **Bulk re-address a whole deployment from one page**, instead of visiting every module's own page to re-type the same new subnet
- **Propose → Review → Apply** — never silently overwrites a module's own IP; proposes a plan against the current live state of every module, shows a current-vs-proposed diff, and only touches anything you explicitly check
- Covers core-17 (MME/AMF/UPF/SGW addresses), Security Gateway, VoWiFi, 2G GSM, IMS, PSTN's external trunk, and MMS — SEPP and the DNS listen address are always plan-only, since their only live-apply path is a much larger action better done from their own dedicated pages
- Live per-row restart-cost hints before you apply anything

### RAN Kill Switches *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **Real, disruptive actions on live radios**, not a simulation — the 2G one in particular has a genuinely different real-world impact than the other three.

- **Five Dashboard buttons**: Block RAN (all four generations at once) plus Block 2G / 3G / 4G / 5G individually — each flashes red for as long as anything of that generation is currently blocked, and doubles as the unblock-all action while flashing
- **4G/5G/3G** sever the radio's own path to the core on this host only (nftables) — the radio itself is never touched and can be restored instantly
- **2G is genuinely different** — it's a real administrative lock at osmo-bsc itself, dropping every camped UE immediately, the same real device-level action as the per-radio Block button on the RAN page
- The same flash-red "currently blocked" indicator also applies to every individual per-radio Block/Unblock button on the RAN page, not just the Dashboard's aggregate buttons

### SigScale OCS (Online Charging) *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **This module is in beta** and touches an always-on core NF's Diameter peer list (SMF). `ENABLE_OCS_MODULE` defaults **disabled** (opt-in).

- **Real-time prepaid credit-control charging** — Diameter Gy (data) wired to Open5GS SMF's own native Gy client (present since v2.4.7, previously completely dormant in this deployment), plus Diameter Ro (voice/airtime charging) sharing the same listener
- **4G/EPC only** — Open5GS's SMF has no 5G online-charging (Nchf) client upstream, so 5G NR sessions are never covered by this integration
- **One-button Configure** — installs SigScale OCS (a real Erlang/OTP application via its own apt package), registers SMF as a trusted Diameter client, upserts the Gy peer into `smf.conf`, and verifies a real `STATE_OPEN` connection
- No rating-plan/balance/subscriber CRUD in this NMS — links out to OCS's own Polymer web GUI and REST API docs instead
- Getting real charging fully working (both Gy and Ro) surfaced and fixed 9 separate real bugs across freeDiameter-vs-cdp connectivity quirks and the compiled `ims_charging.so` module itself — see `docs/features.md` for the full writeup

### Charging Plans *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **Beta.** Depends on SigScale OCS being installed and configured first.

- **A deliberately simplified data + voice cap GUI** over SigScale OCS's own full rating-plan vocabulary — built per direct user feedback that "the sigscale gui is too complex"
- One GUI "Plan" (name + data cap GB + voice cap minutes) maps to one real OCS bundle offer
- **Auto-provisioned "Unlimited" plan** on every OCS Configure — a deliberately huge finite cap (1,000,000 GB / 1,000,000 min), not a dedicated no-cap code path
- Subscriber assignment from the Subscribers page, both bulk-select and per-row
- A known, still-unresolved OCS-side rating-engine bug can leak stuck reservations across subscribers — mitigated by an automatic background guard that sweeps and clears stale reservations every 30 minutes (a mitigation, not a fix for the underlying engine bug)

### Call History (CDR) *(Beta)*

> ⚠️ **Beta.** One of three phases is not yet confirmed working end-to-end — see below.

- **Unified call detail records across PSTN, 2G, and 4G/5G IMS**, synced into their own MongoDB collection from each system's own real source (not a fresh primary store)
- **Phase 1 (PSTN Gateway)** — stable, verified against a real 76+-row dataset
- **Phase 2 (Asterisk-2G)** — code deployed, but a real end-to-end test-call confirmation is still outstanding
- **Phase 3 (direct 4G/5G IMS-to-IMS calls)** — via Kamailio's own `acc` module, confirmed fully working end-to-end against real test calls, independent runtime toggle from its own compile-time build flag
- Configurable retention (default 180 days)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (or compatible Linux distribution)
- **Open5GS 2.7+** installed and configured
- **MongoDB 6.0+** running on localhost
- **Docker Engine 24.0+** and **Docker Compose v2.20+**

> Optional modules (IMS/VoLTE, SMS over SGs, FRR-from-source, Syslog Forwarding) install their own additional host packages on first use, directly from their respective pages — see **[docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md#software-requirements)** for the full list before enabling them.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/paulmataruso/open5gs-nms
cd open5gs-nms

# Configure environment (required — see Authentication section below)
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Build and start all services
docker compose up --build -d

# Access the web interface
open http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8888
```

For detailed installation instructions, see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

### First Login

On first startup, an admin account is created automatically.

**Option A — Set your own password (recommended):**

Add this to your `.env` before running `docker compose up`:

```bash
FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
```

Then log in with username `admin` and the password you set. Clear `FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD` from `.env` after your first login.

**Option B — Auto-generated password:**

Leave `FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD` empty. A random password is generated and printed once to the container logs:

```bash
docker logs open5gs-nms-backend 2>&1 | grep -A4 "FIRST RUN"
```

Expected output:
```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  FIRST RUN — Admin account created
  Username : admin
  Password : Xk7mQ2pL9nRv4wYa
  Change this password after first login!
════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

> **Missed the password?** Delete the auth database and restart:
> ```bash
> docker compose down && rm -f ./data/auth.db && docker compose up -d
> ```

### Auth Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Initial admin password. Auto-generated if empty. Clear after first login. |
| `SESSION_MAX_AGE` | `86400` | Session lifetime in seconds (default: 24 hours) |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set to `true` **only** when serving over HTTPS. Setting this to `true` on plain HTTP silently breaks login. |
| `AUTH_DB_PATH` | `/app/data/auth.db` | Path to SQLite auth database inside container. Must match the `./data:/app/data` volume mount. |

### HTTPS Deployments

When running behind HTTPS (nginx + SSL), set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in `.env`:

```bash
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

See **[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)** for full nginx SSL configuration.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Open5GS NMS follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Browser (React 18 + TypeScript + JointJS)                  │
│  http://YOUR_SERVER:8888                                     │
└───────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                │ REST API         │ WebSocket
                ▼                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  nginx Reverse Proxy (Alpine)                                │
│  Proxies /api → backend:3001                                 │
│  Upgrades WebSocket → backend:3002                           │
└───────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                │                  │
                ▼                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Backend (Node.js 20 + TypeScript + Express)                │
│  Clean Architecture: Domain → Application → Infrastructure   │
│  Auth: Lucia v3 sessions → SQLite (auth.db)                 │
│  Container: privileged, network_mode: host                   │
└─────┬──────────┬──────────┬───────────┬──────────────────┬─┘
      │          │          │           │                  │
      ▼          ▼          ▼           ▼                  ▼
 /etc/open5gs  systemd   MongoDB    auth.db           /var/log
 (bind mount)  (via dbus) (host:27017) (./data volume) (bind mount)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The NMS is configured through environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize:

```bash
# Authentication (review before first deploy)
FIRST_RUN_PASSWORD=your-password    # Initial admin password
SESSION_MAX_AGE=86400               # Session lifetime in seconds
COOKIE_SECURE=false                 # Set true only for HTTPS deployments

# Backend
PORT=3001
WS_PORT=3002
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/open5gs
CONFIG_PATH=/etc/open5gs
LOG_LEVEL=info
HOST_SYSTEMCTL_PATH=/usr/bin/systemctl

# Simlessly eSIM API (Subscribers page — "Generate eSIM", optional)
SIMLESSLY_ACCESS_KEY=          # From your Simlessly account's Developer module
SIMLESSLY_SECRET_KEY=          # Same place — never commit real values
```

Default values work for most deployments. For production, see **[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)**.

### eSIM Generation (Simlessly)

The Subscribers page can generate real eSIM activation codes via the
[Simlessly](https://docs.simlessly.com) RSP platform's Single Generate AC API. This
requires `SIMLESSLY_ACCESS_KEY`/`SIMLESSLY_SECRET_KEY` — obtained by logging into your
own Simlessly account's Developer module. Without them, the JSON preview/copy still
works, but "Generate via Simlessly API" will return an error. See
**[docs/features.md](docs/features.md#esim-generator-simlessly-api)** for details.

---

## 🛡️ Security

### What's protected
- All API endpoints require a valid session cookie
- Login is rate-limited (10 attempts / 15 min per IP)
- Passwords are bcrypt-hashed
- Session cookies are HttpOnly (not accessible to JavaScript)
- Auth data is stored in a separate SQLite database — the Open5GS MongoDB is never touched for auth

### Production recommendations

1. **Enable HTTPS** — Configure nginx SSL termination (Let's Encrypt) and set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in `.env`
2. **Network restrictions** — Deploy behind a VPN or firewall for internet-exposed instances
3. **Regular backups** — Automate backup jobs and store copies off-site
4. **Monitoring** — Set up external monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

See **[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md)** for detailed hardening guidance.

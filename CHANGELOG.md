# Changelog

All notable changes to open5gs-nms are documented here.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.63] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed — VoWiFi Live Sessions page crashing to a blank/grey screen

- The session list's S2b/PGW column read `s.s2b.pgw` unguarded — VectorCore
  ePDG's own API omits the `s2b` key entirely (not `null`, just absent)
  while a session's PGW handshake hasn't completed yet, which threw and
  blanked the page the moment a new WiFi Calling session appeared. Now
  shows "S2b pending…" for that window instead of crashing.

### Docs — README rewritten in product voice, not engineering-journal voice

- Every feature section now describes what the module does today, not the
  debugging journey to get it there — removed "Phase N" internal-tracking
  language, "we fixed N bugs" narration, and stale "not yet confirmed"
  hedges throughout.
- Corrected several stale claims: VoWiFi-to-VoLTE calling works (previously
  described as having an open issue), the PSTN external SIP trunk has a
  real provider connected and working (previously described as
  unconfigured), and Call History is fully working across all three of its
  sources (previously described as partially unconfirmed).

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.62] - 2026-09-22

### Docs — full accuracy pass across every markdown file in the repo

- Corrected a repo-wide stale reference to a since-removed separate WebSocket
  port (3002) — the WebSocket upgrade has shared the REST port since
  v2.0-beta_0.4 — across README, ARCHITECTURE, api-reference, requirements,
  deployment, development, troubleshooting, and CONTRIBUTING.
- ARCHITECTURE.md's Security Limitations section claimed no multi-user
  support/RBAC exists — false; real admin/viewer role-based access control
  is enforced on every route. Rewritten to describe what's actually there.
- docs/api-reference.md was missing roughly half the app's real API
  namespaces from its module table — added them all.
- docs/features.md had zero coverage of the MMS module — added a full
  section.
- VECTORCORE_UPSTREAM_PATCHES.md documented 2 of 6 real, currently-applied
  upstream patches — added full writeups for the other 4 from the actual
  patch source.
- THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md had no attribution at all for Osmocom, Kamailio,
  Asterisk, PyHSS, or SigScale OCS despite them being core runtime
  dependencies — added all five, with license info verified from local
  source/package files rather than assumed.
- Fixed a stale test-plan PLMN, several broken example commands, dead
  `docker-compose.prod.yml`/fake version-tag references, unfilled
  `YOUR_ORG` placeholders, and a missing FRR eigrpd operational warning
  (the naive restart path triggers the known crash; the live `vtysh`
  method doesn't) across INSTALL.md and the rest of docs/.
- Removed `docs/vectorcore-epdg-integration-plan.md` (an implementation
  plan already shipped) and the orphaned root-level
  `open5gs-network-topology.svg` (confirmed zero references first).

### Docs — screenshots for every section added since the last screenshot pass

- Added real screenshots for PSTN/Voice Gateway, 2G GSM, 3G UMTS, RF
  Planning, IP Plan Tool, RAN Kill Switches, SigScale OCS, Charging Plans,
  and Call History (CDR).
- The Call History screenshot contained a real personal phone number
  across 9 cells — found and redacted before publishing.

## [v2.0-beta_0.61] - 2026-09-21

### Added — IP Plan Tool: bulk re-addressing via explicit Propose → Review → Apply

- One page to re-address a whole deployment instead of visiting every module's own
  page one at a time. "Propose IP Plan" reads every module's *current* live state
  fresh (never a cached registry) and suggests non-colliding addresses only for
  modules still pointing at a gap — anything already real proposes no change and
  starts unchecked. Review shows current vs. proposed with a per-row checkbox and a
  restart-cost hint; nothing is written until "Apply Plan."
- Live-apply, opt-in per row: core-17 (batched into one Auto-Configuration apply),
  Security Gateway, VoWiFi, 2G GSM, IMS, PSTN's external trunk, MMS. Always
  plan-only, never live-apply: SEPP's three address fields, the DNS listen address
  — their live-apply paths are disproportionately large for what this tool does.
- Full redesign of an earlier version that silently wrote back to a shared registry
  after any module's own independent Configure — corrected after direct feedback
  that a planning tool should only ever act on an explicit click, never as a side
  effect of using some other page. The old bulk-save endpoint and its frontend
  client method were deleted outright as part of the rewrite, not just stopped
  being called.

### Added — RAN Kill Switches: Block 2G / 3G / 4G / 5G, plus an expanded "Block all"

- Five Dashboard buttons: an aggregate that now genuinely covers all four RAN
  generations at once (previously 4G-only despite the name), plus each generation
  individually. Each button flashes red for as long as anything of that generation
  is currently blocked, and doubles as the unblock-all action while flashing.
- 3G had no blocking mechanism at all before this — built a new nftables-based
  block service from scratch, mirroring the existing 4G/5G pattern.
- 2G reuses the real per-BTS osmo-bsc administrative lock, not a host-only network
  rule — genuinely different, higher-impact blast radius than the other three
  (drops camped UEs immediately), so it's deliberately styled differently in the UI
  rather than looking identical to the mild ones.
- The same flash-red "currently blocked" indicator now also applies to every
  individual per-radio Block/Unblock button on the RAN page itself, not just the
  Dashboard's aggregate buttons.

### Fixed — the 2G BTS Block/Unblock feature never actually worked, since it was built

- Found live-testing the new RAN Kill Switches feature above — its first-ever real
  UI trigger. The command it sent was accepted with zero error anywhere (no VTY
  error, no journalctl error) but silently had no effect: osmo-bsc runs a
  background reconciliation loop that automatically re-unlocks that exact class of
  radio object, and the old command had no way to prevent it.
- Root-caused by reading osmo-bsc's own real source code, not guessed. Fixed with
  a completely different, correct VTY command that does have the right guard
  against that reconciliation loop. This also means the restart-recovery path (
  re-locking a blocked BTS after an osmo-bsc restart) never actually worked either,
  for as long as the 2G module has existed.

### Fixed — PSTN Gateway: early ringback now covers every GSM-routed call path

- A prior fix added an immediate ringback signal to inbound DID calls routed to a
  2G subscriber, so a real external caller's own server doesn't give up while
  real radio paging is still in progress. That fix only covered DID-mapped calls;
  it's now applied to every other GSM-routed dial path in the PSTN Gateway's
  dialplan too (auto-dial-by-MSISDN, and Cross-RAN Calling's forwarding entries).

### Added — SigScale OCS: real-time online charging (Diameter Gy + Ro)

- Wires Open5GS SMF's own native Diameter Gy client (present since v2.4.7,
  previously completely dormant in this deployment) to a newly-installed SigScale
  OCS for real prepaid credit-control charging on 4G/EPC data sessions.
  4G/EPC only — Open5GS's SMF has no 5G online-charging client upstream.
- Voice/airtime charging (Diameter Ro) shares the same listener, completing a
  dormant block the IMS config template already carried.
- Getting real charging working end-to-end surfaced and fixed 9 separate real
  bugs, from Diameter port/bind conflicts to five distinct bugs inside the
  compiled Kamailio charging module itself — see `docs/features.md` for the
  full writeup.

### Added — Charging Plans: a simplified data + voice cap GUI over SigScale OCS

- One GUI "Plan" (name, data cap, voice cap) instead of SigScale's own full
  rating-plan vocabulary, built per direct feedback that the underlying GUI was
  too complex for day-to-day plan management. Auto-provisions an "Unlimited"
  plan on every OCS Configure.
- Fixed a real bug where a subscriber's data and voice usage could silently draw
  from two disconnected pools instead of one shared one.
- A still-unresolved bug in OCS's own rating engine can leak stuck charging
  reservations — mitigated by an automatic background sweep, not yet fixed at
  the root (upstream source unavailable to patch directly).

### Added — Call History: unified call detail records across PSTN, 2G, and IMS

- Three independently risk-staged phases into one shared collection: PSTN
  Gateway (stable, verified against a real dataset), Asterisk-2G (code deployed,
  real end-to-end confirmation still outstanding), and direct 4G/5G IMS-to-IMS
  calls via Kamailio's own accounting module (confirmed working end-to-end
  against real test calls, including a call that fell to voicemail and a
  PSTN-Gateway-routed call correctly split into its real two B2BUA dialogs).

### Added — PSTN Gateway: real external SIP trunk + inbound DID mapping

- A real, off-host-reachable transport (not loopback, unlike every other trunk
  peer this project had before), a firewall allowlist, and inbound DID→subscriber
  mapping — all four buildable phases shipped. Real provider connectivity is
  deliberately not configured yet, since there's nothing to connect to on this
  deployment.
- Every subscriber's own real MSISDN is now internally dialable system-wide,
  auto-routed to IMS or 2G by their own provisioned state, alongside their
  existing extension short codes, with zero changes to any existing short code.

### Fixed — 2G call setup: hardcoded MNCC timer, and no route to external PSTN

- `osmo-sip-connector`'s `MNCC_SETUP_COMPL_IND` had a hardcoded 5s timeout that
  a real over-the-air CONNECT round trip could legitimately exceed under normal
  GSM scheduling, tearing down a call both legs had just marked connected.
  Widened to 15s for just that call site; baked into the module's own build
  pipeline so a reinstall picks it up too.
- Asterisk-2G's dialplan had no real route to the external PSTN trunk — a 2G
  subscriber dialing a genuine external number silently looped back into
  `osmo-msc` as an unrecognized-subscriber request instead of ever reaching
  PSTN. Fixed by routing anything that isn't a known subscriber's own MSISDN
  out through the PSTN Gateway's trunk instead.
- `radio-link-timeout` raised from 32 to 64 (osmo-bsc's real configurable max)
  as a mitigation for a real, intermittent 2G radio-link reliability problem
  found on real hardware — **not fully resolved**; if a 2G call still fails
  intermittently, this is very likely the BTS's own hardware/RF condition,
  not something fixable in this project's code.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.60] - 2026-09-15

### Added — Cross-RAN Calling: bridge 4G/5G and 2G short codes across both Asterisk instances

- One toggle ("Enable Cross-RAN Calling", Voice Gateway page → Extensions tab) peers
  the PSTN Gateway's Asterisk instance with Asterisk-2G's own instance via a new
  inter-Asterisk PJSIP trunk in each direction, with real AMR/AMR-WB ↔ GSM-FR
  transcoding — the first time this project transcodes real call audio rather than
  just relaying it. Dialplan entries on each side *forward, not resolve* — dialing
  the other side's short code re-enters that side's own dialplan at the identical
  digit string, where its own existing per-mapping `Dial()` logic completes the call
  unchanged, so neither side needs to know the other's subscriber mapping.
- Codec order is deliberately different per leg (each endpoint lists its own
  downstream destination's native codec first) to bias negotiation toward exactly
  one transcode hop per call instead of risking two; both new trunk endpoints carry
  the same `rtp_keepalive`/B2BUA hardening settings as the existing trunks, applied
  proactively this time rather than needing another live-debug cycle to rediscover
  the same class of bug.
- A one-time collision sweep runs at enable time across both short-code registries;
  a cheaper, `crossRanEnabled`-gated version of the same check also runs on every
  new single-side short-code add, so two deployments that never intend to bridge
  can still freely reuse the same codes.
- Confirmed live with real over-the-air calls in both directions, full bidirectional
  audio verified via packet capture (not just clean signaling).

### Fixed — real 2G TCH-assignment failures were a config bug, not hardware

- Real GSM calls (both native 2G↔2G and the new Cross-RAN path) were failing 100%
  of the time with `osmo-bsc`'s `Assignment Failure`/`Received NACK on IPACC CRCX`,
  previously believed to be an inherent real-hardware RF reliability issue. Root
  cause: `osmo-bsc.cfg` declared `codec-support fr` (GSM-FR only) while `amr-config`
  still permitted an AMR rate — an internally inconsistent pair — even though the
  real nanoBTS's own live OML Feature Vector explicitly reports it supports AMR.
  Fixed to `codec-support fr amr`, matching the BTS's real reported capability.
- Fix validated live via VTY before touching any config file (the setting applies
  only to newly-created lchans, so this needed no service restart), then confirmed
  end-to-end with a real BTS power-cycle and fresh packet-captured test calls.

### Added — Voice Gateway: 2G Short Codes, PSTN Gateway renamed and merged with Asterisk-2G

- The PSTN Gateway page is now "Voice Gateway" and covers both Asterisk instances
  from one page — status, Extensions (now split into "4G/5G Short Codes" and "2G
  Short Codes" sections, matching visual treatment), and a merged Config Files tab.
- 2G Short Codes: assign a short code to a 2G-enabled subscriber so other 2G phones
  can dial them without the full MSISDN, mirroring the existing 4G/5G extensions
  feature.

### Fixed — real PSTN Gateway / Asterisk-2G no-audio bug (`rtp_keepalive`)

- Short-code calls had full audio in one direction and zero audio in the reverse
  direction, reproduced identically on repeat. Root-caused via live packet capture
  and Asterisk's own DEBUG-level logging across several real test calls: with
  `rtp_symmetric=yes`, a leg's real send destination is learned only from its first
  inbound packet rather than trusted from the SDP answer — a call whose very first
  learn-then-transmit attempt loses a timing race has nothing to ever retry it, so
  that leg stays permanently silent even though the bridge itself looks healthy.
  Fixed with `rtp_keepalive=5` on both the PSTN Gateway's and Asterisk-2G's trunk
  endpoints (applied proactively to Asterisk-2G before it ever hit the same bug).

### Changed — app-wide page-header coherence pass

- ~25 frontend pages brought in line with the established header convention (title/
  subtitle block on the left, status badges + action buttons on the right, centered
  pill-style tab bars where applicable) — no functional changes.

### Added — 3G UMTS via OsmoHNBGW (alpha, opt-in, `ENABLE_HNBGW_MODULE`)

- New module bridging a 3G femtocell's Iuh interface to the existing `osmo-msc`
  (IuCS) and `osmo-sgsn` (IuPS) over the already-running `osmo-stp`, source-built
  (not an apt package) against this host's actual installed Osmocom libraries.
  Reuses the 2G module's own `gsmEnabled` subscriber flag (relabeled "2G/3G Auth")
  and its `auc_3g` MILENAGE row rather than adding a parallel flag. Needs a real HNB
  (e.g. an ip.access nano3G) or OsmoHNodeB (a software test HNB, deployable from the
  module's own page) to actually attach anything — no real hardware validated yet.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.59] - 2026-09-13

### Added — Asterisk-2G: a second, fully isolated Asterisk instance for real 2G voice calling

- New `asterisk-2g-controller.ts` module (own config tree `/etc/asterisk-2g`, own
  systemd unit, own loopback IP `127.0.1.7`) — the SIP peer osmo-sip-connector needs
  to actually complete 2G-to-2G calls in External MNCC mode (see v0.58's "explicit
  call-routing control" — osmo-msc's internal MNCC handler signals but never bridges
  audio). Its one-line dialplan recognizes a dialed number as a local subscriber and
  re-originates the call back out through the same trunk, which is what lets the MT
  leg complete via osmo-msc with no third SIP hop and no infinite loop. Shares only
  the underlying apt package with the completely separate Asterisk instance the PSTN
  Gateway module owns — never its config, service, or lifecycle.
- **One button** (GSM page → new **2G Voice** tab, gated on
  `ENABLE_ASTERISK_2G_MODULE`, defaults disabled) installs, configures, points the
  SIP tab's remote peer at Asterisk-2G, and switches MNCC to External — all in one
  action, with a symmetric reset back to Internal mode on uninstall. Reconsidered
  from an initially-planned manual+helper-button design after confirming this
  module's only real job is being that one specific peer.
- PSTN Gateway's uninstall flow now skips purging the shared `asterisk` apt package
  when Asterisk-2G is also installed, so removing one 2G-voice module can't break the
  other's running instance.
- Two real Asterisk bugs found and fixed via live install/uninstall/reinstall
  cycles (verified against PSTN's own instance staying untouched throughout,
  `NRestarts=0`): (1) `astdatadir`/`astagidir` pointed at this instance's own empty
  runtime dir instead of the shared, package-installed `/usr/share/asterisk` —
  Asterisk's Stasis subsystem needs real files there and refused to start
  ("Stasis initialization failed. ASTERISK EXITING!"). (2) The stock `asterisk.conf`
  template's `[directories](!)` marker — copied verbatim since the real stock config
  has it — silently no-ops any directory override that differs from Asterisk's
  compiled-in default, so this instance kept binding the *stock* instance's control
  socket ("Asterisk already running on /var/run/asterisk/asterisk.ctl") until the
  marker was removed.

### Added — Services page / Dashboard: surface the new 2G voice stack

- `osmo-sip-connector` added to the systemd-tracked service list (Services page +
  Dashboard), alongside the existing Osmocom daemons.
- New Asterisk-2G status section/mini-card on both pages (status-API-based, mirroring
  the existing VectorCore pattern rather than the systemd-unit one, since this module
  tracks its own install/configure state). The two Asterisk mini-cards are now
  labeled identically ("Asterisk") with a subtitle disambiguating them ("IMS / 4G-5G"
  vs. "2G GSM") rather than two differently-worded cards that didn't visually pair.
- New "Stop 2G" / "Start 2G" bulk-action button next to the existing 4G/5G ones,
  correctly excluding the shared SMS-core Osmocom services (osmo-stp/hlr/msc) that
  SGs-mode SMS still depends on regardless of whether the 2G radio module is enabled.

### Added — RAN page: per-BTS administrative lock/unlock ("Block radio")

- New "Block"/"Unblock" control per BTS in the RAN page's 2G GSM section (all three
  radio-list layouts), gated behind a confirm modal on Block since — unlike the
  existing 4G/5G "Block" button, which only fires an nftables rule on this host and
  never touches the radio — this sends a real command to osmo-bsc that takes the BTS
  off the air: `change-adm-state locked/unlocked`, entered via
  `bts <N> oml class bts instance 0 0 0`. Live-verified against this project's own
  running osmo-bsc before wiring it up.
- Locking has no persisted equivalent in `osmo-bsc.cfg` (confirmed by inspecting the
  real `bts <N>` config node's full command list) — osmo-bsc forgets it on its own
  restart. `BtsEntry.blocked` now persists the intended state, and a new
  `reapplyBtsLocks()` replays it over VTY after every osmo-bsc restart this module
  triggers (config regen from any BTS add/edit/remove, Configure, or this module's
  own Start/Restart), so a locked BTS can no longer silently come back on the air.
- `bscVtyCommand()` (`gsm-controller.ts`) now accepts multiple commands in one VTY
  session instead of exactly one, needed to enter the `(oml)` node and issue
  `change-adm-state` together without racing a fresh reconnect between them.
- A blocked BTS row now flashes red the same way a blocked 4G/5G radio row already
  did (`animate-flash-red`, matching styling per layout — ring highlight on the Table
  layout, plain flash on Accordion/Split), instead of only showing the static
  "BTS BLOCKED" badge.

### Added — RAN page: per-UE GPRS/EDGE data-session IP

- New "Data IP" column in the RAN page's 2G GSM UE list (all three layouts) showing
  each UE's live PDP context IP — previously this was hardcoded to always show `—`,
  since 2G's CS side genuinely has no PDP-context IP of its own. Sourced from a new
  `GET /api/gsm/pdp-contexts`, which queries osmo-ggsn's own VTY directly (port 4260,
  `show pdp-context ggsn ggsn0`) — osmo-ggsn is the actual address allocator;
  osmo-sgsn only relays the GTP-C signaling. `parsePdpContexts()`'s field layout was
  pulled from osmo-ggsn 1.9.0's own source (`apt-get source osmo-ggsn` →
  `ggsn/ggsn_vty.c`'s `show_one_pdp_v4only()`) and read directly rather than guessed
  from the VTY reference PDF, which turned out to be an auto-generated command-syntax
  tree with no sample output at all. `bscVtyCommand()` generalized to `osmoVtyCommand
  (port, cmd)` so this and any future daemon's VTY can reuse the same connection
  script instead of duplicating it per daemon.

### Fixed — BTS Block/Unblock: wrong OML object-instance address took the real radio off the air

**Real production incident, found live**: Block then Unblock against the real nanoBTS
left it off the air for ~45 minutes — Unblock reported success but nothing changed.
Root cause confirmed via `osmo-bsc`'s own `journalctl` output: the OML object-instance
triple used for `change-adm-state` was `(idx, 0, 0)`; the correct one for NM object
class "bts" is `(idx, 255, 255)` (trx/ts wildcarded — the top-level BTS object has no
specific trx/timeslot). The real radio NACK'd the wrong address
(`CHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE NACK CAUSE=Object Instance unknown`), and `osmo-bsc`'s
own reaction to any such NACK is to immediately drop the whole OML link — cascading
every child NM object into a locked/not-installed state. The NACK never surfaces as
VTY error text (only in `osmo-bsc`'s own log), which is why Unblock silently did
nothing. Recovery required a clean `systemctl restart osmo-bsc` to force a fresh OML
handshake — the corrected code alone wasn't enough to un-wedge the already-broken
session. Fixed: corrected instance address in both `setBtsBlocked()` and
`reapplyBtsLocks()`; `setBtsBlocked()` now re-reads `show bts <idx>` after the command
and fails loudly (502, does not persist `blocked`) if the real reported `adminState`
doesn't match what was requested, instead of trusting the VTY prompt returning
cleanly.

### Docs

- `docs/features.md` gained the "2G GSM (Osmocom)" section it never had (covering
  the module as a whole, not just this release's additions), the RAN-page lock/
  unlock feature, and the per-UE data-IP column; `CLAUDE.md`'s feature-inventory
  table gained the matching row.

## [v2.0-beta_0.58] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed — 2G GSM/Osmocom module: config-ownership landmine, MGW codec routing, explicit call-routing control

- **`configureSms()` no longer blindly regenerates `osmo-msc.cfg`/`osmo-stp.cfg`.**
  Replaced full-file regeneration with a new, reusable ownership-based VTY-config
  merge utility (`domain/services/vty-config-ownership.ts`) — each caller declares
  only the directives it owns; everything else already on disk (SS7 point-code, A5
  ciphering, SMPP/ESME entries incl. live passwords, `mncc-int` codec defaults) is
  preserved byte-for-byte. Verified with a 16-case unit suite and a real live
  uninstall→reinstall→reconfigure pipeline test with byte-exact prediction matching.
- **osmo-sip-connector and the two Kamailio IMS module `.so` patches now have real,
  reproducible build/install code** (`osmo-sip-connector-build.ts`,
  `kamailio-ims-modules-build.ts`) wired into the 2G module's and IMS's own Install
  steps, respectively — previously these existed only as manual, host-only artifacts
  with no way to reproduce them on a fresh deployment.
- **2G module uninstall was deleting shared `osmo-stp`/`osmo-hlr`/`osmo-msc` config
  files** despite `GSM_CONFIG_MANIFEST` already flagging them `shared: true` — the
  deletion loop never actually checked that flag. Fixed before it could cause damage
  in a live pipeline test.
- **Real, root-caused call-path bugs found via live end-to-end call testing on real
  radio hardware** (all invisible until an actual voice call was attempted, since
  attach/SMS/GPRS never exercise these paths):
  - osmo-msc's and osmo-bsc's `mgw endpoint-domain` were set to `msc`/`bsc`
    respectively — osmo-mgw itself defaults to expecting literally `mgw`, so every
    real call's MGCP CRCX was rejected outright ("wrong domain name ... expecting
    mgw"). Fixed both to `mgw`.
  - A leftover `mncc external <path>` in `osmo-msc.cfg` (from an earlier, since-
    reverted 2G↔IMS voice-interop attempt) was silently routing **every** 2G call,
    including a plain call between two local subscribers, out to
    osmo-sip-connector's socket with no operator-visible cause. Call-routing mode
    (internal/external) is now an explicit, persisted operator choice — see below —
    rather than an accidental leftover file value.
  - **Confirmed, not yet worked around**: osmo-msc's own internal/built-in MNCC
    handler (`mncc_builtin.c`, upstream Osmocom, not this project's code) never
    implements `MNCC_RTP_CREATE` — real signaling (attach, ringing, answer) completes
    but no actual RTP bridge is ever created, so a call hangs and times out. Real
    2G↔2G audio needs the external MNCC path (osmo-sip-connector); internal mode is
    signaling-only on this osmo-msc version.

### Added — GSM page: explicit call-routing mode control

- New "Call Routing" control on the SIP tab: **Internal** (default — osmo-msc/osmo-mgw
  route calls themselves) vs. **External** (hand every call to osmo-sip-connector).
  Backed by a new `POST /api/gsm/sip/mncc-mode` endpoint and a live-read
  `getMscMnccMode()` (never cached state) so the UI can never drift from what
  osmo-msc is actually doing, plus a warning banner when External is selected but the
  connector isn't running.
- BTS/Radios tab and the Add/Edit BTS modal rebuilt to match the rest of the app's
  established table/modal conventions (was a single cramped wrapping row with no
  scroll-safe modal — the edit dialog's top/bottom could be clipped by the browser).

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.57] - 2026-09-07

### Added — RF Planning: ITM/Longley-Rice model, ESA WorldCover land-cover data, Point Analysis map

- **ITM (Longley-Rice) propagation model, Phase C**, completing the propagation-model
  set to 7 total. Vendored NTIA's own public-domain reference implementation
  (`backend/vendor/itm-src`) rather than reimplementing it, compiled to WASM
  (`backend/src/domain/rf/wasm/itm`) and called from `itm-model.ts`. Verified across
  all 7 propagation models via direct API calls, including one real ITM edge-case bug
  found and fixed along the way.
- **ESA WorldCover land-cover pipeline** (`landcover-provider.ts`): fetches 3°×3°
  Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF tiles from the public `esa-worldcover` S3 bucket on demand,
  caches raw tiles on the host disk (mirroring `elevation-provider.ts`'s existing SRTM
  cache pattern), and does windowed single-pixel reads rather than decoding a whole
  ~1GB+ tile per query. Feeds an "auto-detect environment from real land cover" option
  for the Hata/COST-231-Hata/Walfisch-Ikegami models' environment/city-type inputs,
  clearly disclosed as an `Assumption` distinct from an ordinary unset-input default.
- **Point Analysis now has a real map** (`PointAnalysisTab.tsx`, extracted out of
  `RfPlanningPage.tsx` to its own file to match `CoverageMapTab.tsx`'s precedent) —
  draggable Site/Target markers with a Placing toggle, replacing plain lat/lon fields.

### Fixed — RF Planning Coverage Map: multi-radio selection, drag, and delete

A real, multi-round bug arc on the multi-radio Coverage Map: selecting a radio,
dragging it, and deleting it were all unreliable once more than one radio (especially
a 3-sector tower, where every sector shares one exact coordinate) was on the map.

- **Root cause**: the currently-selected radio was rendered twice — the real
  draggable marker, plus an un-excluded ghost cone/dot from the "other saved sites"
  loop at the same coordinate — so clicks could land on the wrong layer. Fixed by
  excluding the loaded site from that loop.
- Removed the map-click-relocates-the-active-radio handler entirely (it fired on any
  empty-space click, silently relocating whatever was currently loaded); moving a
  radio is drag-only now, placing a new one goes through Add Radio / Quick Add.
  The selected radio now renders with a distinct gold halo marker instead of
  Leaflet's plain default pin, so "which radio is selected and draggable" is visible
  at a glance instead of relying on remembering a previous click.
- **Found the actual cause of "the delete button does nothing"**: left-clicking a
  not-yet-selected radio's dot both opened its bound popup *and* triggered a reload
  that immediately re-rendered the "other sites" layer group with that same dot now
  excluded (since it just became the loaded one) — destroying the dot, and the popup
  that had just opened on it, before it could be clicked. Added right-click as a
  direct, popup-independent delete on any radio (dot or active marker) — no
  selection step, no dependency on popup timing.
  `deleteSite` also now re-syncs the marker/form state when the deleted radio was the
  loaded one — it previously left the marker sitting exactly where it was after a
  successful delete, which looked exactly like the delete had silently failed.
- **Replaced leaflet-draw's own Edit/Delete toolbar** (a real leaflet-draw 1.0.4 +
  Leaflet 1.9.x rough edge, not just a mislabeled button) with a single custom
  "Clear Drawn Area" map control backed by plain code instead of a 3rd-party
  edit-mode state machine.
- **Quick Add 3-Sector Site** now opens a small dialog for tower name, starting
  azimuth, sector spacing, and beamwidth instead of hardcoding an even 120° split and
  silently inheriting whatever beamwidth happened to already be in the main form.

### Added — RF Planning Coverage Map: tower grouping

`RfPlanningSite` gained an optional `towerId`, shared by every sector a 3-Sector Site
creates together. Dragging any one sector now moves the whole tower as one object
(uniform lat/lon delta applied to every member, persisted in one update); "Ungroup
Tower" clears it so sectors can be moved independently again. As a side effect,
dragging any radio (grouped or not) now always persists immediately instead of
risking a silent loss if a different radio was loaded before the drag was ever
explicitly saved.

### Added — Traffic History: split Up/Down graphs, drag-to-zoom

Upload and Download are now two separate graphs, each with its own scale, instead of
one shared chart with two overlaid areas — a large burst in one direction no longer
visually flattens the other. Added Grafana-style click-and-drag zoom (shared across
both graphs, so dragging either one zooms both), via a new reusable
`useZoomableChartData` hook.

### Fixed — TWAMP History: RTT spike drowning out smaller values, drag-to-zoom

Added the same drag-to-zoom to the RTT/Jitter graph, plus a Linear/Log toggle for the
ms axis — an occasional real RTT spike (a retry, brief congestion) was stretching the
linear scale enough that Avg RTT/Min RTT/Jitter flattened to near-zero. Log scale
floors values to a tiny epsilon only for its own render (never the underlying data or
the linear view), since recharts' log scale breaks on an exact 0.

### Fixed — Drag-to-zoom selection box invisible at exactly 24 hours

Both new drag-to-zoom charts formatted labels as time-only ("HH:MM", no date) for any
range under ~1.5 days. At exactly 24 hours — the default range on both pages — the
first point (~24h ago) and the last point (now) land on the identical wall-clock
minute, so dragging across the chart (the obvious way to try the feature) landed the
selection on two identically-labeled points that Recharts' category axis couldn't
tell apart, and the highlight box never rendered. Fixed by showing the date once a
range reaches 24 hours instead of waiting until 36, which is the point at which the
collision becomes possible at all.

## [v2.0-beta_0.56] - 2026-09-06

### Added — SNMP Monitoring module, hardened from community PR #31

Reviewed PR #31 (a read-only Net-SNMP agent for PRTG and similar managers), found 15
real issues via a multi-pass automated review with direct verification (not just static
reading — `py_compile`, `smilint`, live `snmpget`/`snmpwalk` against a real running
daemon, concurrent-request testing), and fixed every one before shipping it rather than
merging the PR as-is. The PR's branch had also diverged before roughly 100 files' worth
of already-shipped work, so its content was hand-extracted and applied fresh onto
current `main` instead of merged — nothing else was touched.

- **Embedded Python `pass_persist` agent had an unbalanced parenthesis** on the ogstun
  TX-bytes OID — a genuine `SyntaxError` (confirmed with `python3 -m py_compile`) that
  silently broke all 12 custom Open5GS OIDs even though `/status` reported the agent
  installed and active.
- **Exact-OID `GET` fell through to the `GETNEXT` search on a miss**, returning another
  metric's value mislabeled as the requested OID instead of an honest "no such object" —
  confirmed both by direct execution and, after the fix, by a real `snmpget` against a
  bogus OID correctly returning "No Such Instance."
- **`/stats` memory calculation regex was a JS-string-style doubled backslash inside an
  actual regex literal** (`/:\\s+|\\s+/`), which matches a literal backslash character
  that never occurs in `/proc/meminfo` instead of whitespace — `memoryPercent` silently
  reported `0` on every single request. Fixed and confirmed live: now matches the host's
  real `free`-computed percentage exactly.
- **`validNetwork()` accepted a blank CIDR prefix as an implicit `/0`** — `Number('')`
  coerces to `0`, which passed the 0–32 range check, so a trailing-slash typo
  (`10.0.0.0/`) was silently accepted as a match-everything network instead of being
  rejected, defeating the entire point of the read-only-access CIDR restriction.
- **Embedded MIB failed strict SMIv2 validation** two ways: `MODULE-IDENTITY` omitted
  the mandatory `CONTACT-INFO` clause, and a named enumeration was declared on
  `Integer32` where SMIv2 only permits that on plain `INTEGER`. Confirmed with `smilint`
  — which required first discovering and installing `snmp-mibs-downloader` on this host,
  since it was missing entirely and `smilint` couldn't validate *any* MIB without it,
  including net-snmp's own shipped ones.
- **`ip link show` had no `.catch()` and no `maxBuffer` override**, and duplicated the
  `nsenter` invocation locally instead of using the shared `IHostExecutor` (which already
  sets a 100MB buffer after a past production incident) — an interface-heavy host (this
  one runs SecGW xfrm interfaces, EIGRP, Docker veths, radio VLANs) could take down the
  entire `/stats` endpoint instead of degrading gracefully.
- **`apt-get install snmpd` auto-starts the daemon with Debian's stock default config**
  (community `public`, read-only) before the hardened config was written a few lines
  later — any failure in between left that default-community daemon reachable. Fixed by
  stopping the freshly-installed service immediately, before writing the real config.
- **`/stats` didn't thread the 5G IMSI set into `getActive4GUEs()`**, causing it to
  internally re-run the equivalent of `getActive5GUEs()` a second time on every 15s poll
  — tripling SMF/AMF/gNB load compared to the established pattern already used by
  `get-interface-status.ts`.
- **No `FEATURES` flag at all** — every other module that installs real host software
  (PSTN, MMS, SecGW, TWAMP, RF Planning) is opt-in behind a `VITE_ENABLE_X` build flag;
  this one had none, so every deployment got a nav entry that could `apt-get install` a
  package and open UDP/161 with no build-time opt-out. Now gated behind
  `ENABLE_SNMP_MODULE` (default `false`), with full `Dockerfile`/`docker-compose.yml`/
  `.env.example`/nginx-timeout-regex wiring matching every other opt-in module.
- Also fixed: no install mutual-exclusion lock (a double-click or two admins in
  different tabs could race `apt-get`/config-writes concurrently), no audit-log entry on
  a failed install/action (unlike every other admin-gated mutation in the app), no
  `systemctl is-active` verification after start/restart (could report success while the
  service silently failed to come up), a missing `withCredentials` on the frontend's
  axios instance (would 401 under any cross-origin `VITE_API_URL` deployment), and the
  Services page's boot-enable/disable toggle rendering as clickable with no backend
  endpoint or handler behind it.

All 15 fixes verified live on this host, not just type-checked: real `snmpget`/
`snmpwalk` against the running daemon (including the two previously-broken OIDs), a
real concurrent-install race producing one `409` and one success, real CIDR rejection,
real enable/disable toggling, and a real audit-log query confirming entries.

### Fixed — TWAMP background poller logging a full error-level line every ~60s for a down target

An unreachable TWAMP reflector is a normal, expected outcome the module's own type
system already models as `{ success: false }` — but `twamp-client` exits non-zero to
signal it, and `LocalHostExecutor`'s error/debug log-level split only special-cased
`systemctl is-active`/`is-enabled` as "expected failures." `IHostExecutor.executeCommand()`
now takes an explicit `{ expectedFailure: true }` option so a caller can mark this
itself, rather than the executor guessing from binary names — `runTwampTest()` (shared
by both the on-demand test endpoint and the background poller) now passes it.

### Fixed — UE Signal page completely unreadable for viewer-role users ([#33](https://github.com/paulmataruso/open5gs-nms/issues/33))

`GET /radios` and `GET /overview` in `radio-signal-controller.ts` required the admin
role, so a viewer-role user got a silent `403` on every page load — the frontend's
error handling just left the page in its empty-state default, rendering as "0
configured radio(s)" / "Connect your first radio" even on a deployment with radios
actively configured and reporting real data as admin. This directly contradicted the
page's own "you can monitor but cannot make changes" viewer banner. Both are pure
reads — `publicRadio()` already strips all credential material before returning it —
so they no longer require admin; every mutating route (add/delete/discover/poll/wake)
stays admin-only. Verified live with a real viewer-role account before and after the
fix.

### Docs — refreshed host software prerequisites, added SNMP to the feature list

`docs/requirements.md` had drifted from the real install code in several places: the
FRR from-source build's actual dependency list was missing `texinfo libpam0g-dev
install-info perl`; the VoWiFi row still described an old `osmo-epdg`/`strongswan-epdg`
architecture rather than the current VectorCore ePDG/AAA (Go + eBPF/XDP) build; MMS,
VectorCore SMSC, DNS/BIND9, Security Gateway, TWAMP, and SNMP Monitoring had no rows at
all; UE Validation's real-hardware tabs (`linphone-cli`, a pinned Go toolchain) weren't
documented, only the Docker-simulator path was; Syslog Forwarding was listed as
installing `rsyslog` when it only configures the host's existing one; and the two
silent Open5GS source-patch rebuilds (MME duplicate-release race, SMF late-CSR) had no
build-dependency documentation at all. Added a new "Go toolchain" note covering the
four components (TWAMP, MMS, VectorCore SMSC, QCI Hardware Test) that each self-install
their own exact pinned Go version rather than sharing one. README's feature list also
gained an SNMP Monitoring entry (screenshots to follow).

## [v2.0-beta_0.55] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed — Real VoLTE call failure: Android-as-caller stuck on "Calling...", ~30s hangup delay

Two real, independently-confirmed P-CSCF bugs, found via full packet capture + IMS log
correlation across two live reproduction attempts (Android calling iPhone every time;
iPhone calling Android always worked, which is what made this a real, direction-specific
signaling bug rather than a device/radio issue):

- **PRACK/BYE silently misrouted to I-CSCF.** A stale Record-Route dialog-hash entry left
  over from the *original* INVITE's one-shot P-CSCF→I-CSCF hop (I-CSCF only does Cx-based
  S-CSCF discovery for the initial request — it's never meant to stay in the signaling
  path) gets replayed by `loose_route()` for a *later* in-dialog request (PRACK, BYE),
  resolving `$du` back to I-CSCF instead of the real destination. I-CSCF has no route for
  an already-established dialog and returns `477`, which — for PRACK specifically —
  silently stalled the whole call: the provisional response was never acknowledged, the
  callee's UE never actually alerted, and the caller's client sat on "Calling..." until
  the eventual `486 No Answer` timeout (confirmed live: ~53s, five retransmitted `183`s
  at standard SIP Timer-A doubling — 2s/4s/8s/16s). Fixed with a scoped
  `failure_route[WITHINDLG_STALE_ROUTE]` in `kamailio_pcscf.cfg`: on a `477` from an
  in-dialog relay, retry directly off the Request-URI (already correctly resolved by
  `loose_route()` a few lines earlier) instead of the bad cached `$du`. First attempt at
  this fix used `$du = $null` + `t_relay()` alone and still failed — Kamailio's
  `failure_route` has already consumed the original branch by that point, so a bare
  `t_relay()` has nothing queued to send (`no branches for forwarding`); `append_branch()`
  before `t_relay()` is what actually queues a fresh one. Confirmed via kamailio-pcscf's
  own debug log that the retry now fires and succeeds, on both PRACK and BYE.
- **TCP connection lifetime silently unbounded.** `tcp_connection_lifetime` was set to
  `UE_REGISTRATION_EXPIRES` — an identifier that, confirmed live, is never actually
  `#!define`'d or `#!substdef`'d anywhere in `kamailio_pcscf.cfg` (also used the same
  broken way in several `htable` auto-expire settings and two other modparams — not yet
  investigated whether those have their own live impact). In practice this let dead TCP
  connections (phone's OS closed the real socket — NAT rebind, backgrounding, network
  handoff — but Kamailio never learned that) accumulate in the connection pool
  effectively indefinitely. Once the PRACK/BYE fix above let calls actually reach a clean
  hangup for the first time, this became visible as a ~30s delay ending a call: on
  BYE/NOTIFY delivery, Kamailio worked through a whole backlog of dead reconnect attempts
  (17 of them in one real capture, one per earlier test call made that session) before
  reaching a live one. Fixed by setting an explicit `300`s lifetime — long enough for
  normal call/registration-refresh reuse, short enough that a backlog can't accumulate
  for a full registration period. Confirmed live: hangup now completes within a couple
  seconds.

Both fixes applied to the live host *and* the source template (`deployImsTemplate()`
fully overwrites `kamailio_pcscf.cfg` from the template on every Configure — unlike the
DB schema fixes below, no retroactive-patch logic was needed here for existing
deployments to pick this up on their next Configure).

### Fixed — IMS Configure silently swallowing failures, reporting success when it wasn't

A deployment reported `kamailio-pcscf` crash-looping (`Cannot fork`) on
`Table 'pcscf.pcscf_location' doesn't exist` after a routine `git pull` + Configure.
Root-caused to a chain of silent-failure gaps, all now fixed:

- `sourceKamSql()` swallowed every schema-import error (`2>/dev/null || true` plus an
  empty `catch`), so a missing/broken Kamailio schema file silently created zero tables
  while Install/Configure still reported success. Now verifies each file exists first
  (clear error naming the missing file/apt package) and surfaces real `mysql` errors —
  but only genuine ones: Kamailio's own vendor schema files aren't idempotent (plain
  `CREATE TABLE`, no `IF NOT EXISTS`), so re-sourcing them on a healthy re-Configure
  always throws "already exists" noise. Force-ran every file this function touches
  against every already-populated database on a live host, three times, to empirically
  nail down the exact benign MySQL error codes (1050/1060/1061/1062/1826) versus what
  should actually still fail loudly. Also added `--force` to the import itself — without
  it, `mysql` silently stops at the first error and never applies anything after, a real
  bug that predated this fix and was simply invisible.
- The actual missing table: Kamailio 5.8.x's own vendor schema (`kamailio-mysql-modules`)
  creates a table literally named `location`, not `pcscf_location` — confirmed by diffing
  against Kamailio's own GitHub history (commit `360bccb`, "kamctl: regenerated db
  creation files") that this exact rename landed upstream after 5.8, not in any release
  this project or Ubuntu 24.04 ships. Nothing in this codebase ever created a table named
  `pcscf_location` at all; it only worked anywhere because someone had created/renamed it
  by hand at some undocumented point in the past. Fixed by explicitly creating
  `pcscf_location` (schema copied from a live, working table and verified against it,
  including a real 124-byte Record-Route value round-tripped uncut) instead of relying on
  Kamailio's mismatched vendor default.
- `configureIms`'s service-restart loop fired every `systemctl restart` with
  `.catch(() => {})` and never checked whether the service actually stayed up — a unit
  can restart cleanly per systemd's own bookkeeping and still be dead a second later once
  its own startup logic hits a real error. Now polls `systemctl is-active` for up to 8s
  after every restart (all `bind9`/`mariadb`/`redis-server`/`pyhss-*`/`rtpengine-daemon`/
  all four `kamailio-*` units/`open5gs-smfd`/`pcrfd`/`upfd`) and throws one aggregated
  error naming every service that failed, with its journal tail.
- `configuredWithVersion` was stamped *before* any of the above verification ran, so even
  a hard Configure failure would still clear the "stale config" flag that drives
  `StaleModulesModal` — meaning the very next page load would stop nagging the operator
  to fix it, on a deployment that was actually still broken. Now only stamped after every
  service is confirmed healthy; a failed Configure correctly leaves the staleness flag
  set.
- `scscf.subscriber.record_route` was `VARCHAR(50)` — real Record-Route header chains
  across multiple IMS proxies routinely exceed that, causing a silent MySQL 1406 "Data
  too long" failure on every real `SUBSCRIBE` from a live phone (confirmed firing on live
  traffic, not just RPC-triggered paths). Widened to `TEXT`, matching `active_watchers`'
  own already-correct column for the same field. Since `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` never
  touches an existing table's columns, an explicit `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY COLUMN` was
  added alongside the `CREATE TABLE` so existing deployments get patched on their next
  Configure too, not just fresh installs — tested by reverting a live column back to
  `VARCHAR(50)`, running the exact statement from source, and confirming it re-widened
  correctly with zero data loss.

### Added — Force-deregister button on IMS Live Status

Manual, operator-triggered force-deregister per row on the Live Status table, for
resetting a test device's registration state on demand instead of waiting out its
`Expires` timer. Uses the same `regscscf.dereg_impu` RPC `forceReregisterAllRegisteredUes`
already relies on for automatic post-restart cleanup — but that RPC turned out to be a
"notify and hope the phone reacts" mechanism, not a real hard delete (confirmed:
Kamailio's own `system.listMethods` exposes no forced-removal RPC at all, and a manual
test showed the NOTIFY delivered and acknowledged with a real `200 OK` while the
registration stayed put, reproduced across three different subscribers). The endpoint
now polls the live registrar for up to ~6s after firing and only reports success once
the row is confirmed gone, with an honest message when it isn't rather than a false
"success" toast.

### Added — UE Signal Quality page, opt-in via `ENABLE_UE_SIGNAL_MODULE`

Per-UE RSRP/RSRQ/SINR/BLER/MCS/CQI/throughput correlated with subscriber identity
(IMSI/ICCID/MSISDN), 7-day SQLite history, AES-256-GCM encrypted radio credentials,
admin-triggered downlink wake for idle UEs (community-contributed, PR #32). Native
connector is Baicells-specific — other vendors need the generic JSON connector, which
requires the radio to already expose its own metrics in that shape, so it's called out
both in-app (a banner on the page itself) and in the README. Defaults **enabled**
(`ENABLE_UE_SIGNAL_MODULE=false` to hide it) since the page was already always-on with no
gate at all before this.

### Added — Major Events: `subscriber_auth_rejected` category

New event type for a UE denied due to an unknown IMSI/SIM — not provisioned rather than
a radio/bearer problem. Covers both the 4G/MME path (`OGS_DIAM_S6A_*` Authentication
Information/Update Location failures, decoded to a human-readable reason per error code)
and the 5G/UDM path (`No AuthenticationSubscription`, carrying a SUCI rather than a bare
IMSI). Verified against real `mme.log` output before shipping.

### Fixed — VoWiFi's ePDG dummy interface silently claiming the entire `10.0.1.0/24`

`dummy-epdg` was created with a `/24` mask instead of `/32` — meaning this host's own
routing table treated the *entire* `10.0.1.0/24` block as directly connected via that one
interface, silently blocking every other address in that range from being used for
anything else on the host (found while trying to give an unrelated reverse-engineering
effort its own address in that subnet). Narrowed to `/32`; confirmed ePDG's own process
stayed bound on all its ports (IKE/500, GTPC/2123, GTPU/2152, NAT-T/4500) throughout,
completely unaffected by the mask change.

## [v2.0-beta_0.54] - 2026-08-30

### Added — QCI / dedicated-bearer validation, two ways

Neither the existing radio/NAS validation test (PDU sessions use QCI=9, no IMS involved)
nor the linphonec-only VoLTE test (pure SIP/IMS, no RRC/S1AP at all) could ever exercise
a real dedicated QCI=1 bearer request — exactly the gap exposed by this session's earlier
Nokia VoLTE investigation, where a disabled radio-side LMT setting silently broke every
real call without any existing test catching it. Closed from two directions:

- **Simulated-core test** (`qci-validation-controller.ts`, new "QCI / Dedicated Bearer
  Test" card on the Validation page): attaches a real srsue+srsenb pair (ZMQ RF loopback,
  no real radio) on the IMS APN using one identity shared between a real Mongo/NAS
  subscriber and a PyHSS IMS identity, then runs `linphonec` inside that UE's own network
  namespace to place a real SIP call — triggering the actual Rx→Gx→S1AP dedicated-bearer
  chain end-to-end. Validates the *core's* own bearer-request logic, not any specific
  radio's admission control. Built, then debugged live through a real first-run cycle —
  fixed a `docker exec` missing `-i` (stdin never reached linphonec), a docker-outside-of-
  docker volume-mount path mismatch (the container's `/config` silently resolved to
  nothing on the real host), an `apt-get` lock race between two concurrent installs inside
  the same container, IMSI allocation drifting into a stale pre-migration PLMN block
  (999-070) once any legacy subscriber outranked it, MCC losing its zero-padding
  (`"001"` parsed as bare `1`, rejected outright by srsenb's config parser), a missing
  default route inside the UE's own network namespace, a hangup-confirmation race that
  could fail a fully working call, and a bearer-failure log-classifier false positive
  (matched an unrelated MME log line sharing the same `Cause[Group:X Cause:Y]` shape).
  Confirmed live: real registration, real INVITE/answer, and real bidirectional RTP audio
  all succeeding end-to-end on the simulated core.
- **Real-hardware test** (`qci-hw-test-controller.ts`, new operator-triggered tool):
  reuses Open5GS's own compiled S1AP ASN.1 codec via a small cgo shim to synthesize a real
  E-RABSetupRequest against a real, already-attached UE on a real radio — pick a radio,
  confirm your own phone is on it (re-checked server-side, not just trusted from the UI),
  pick a QCI, dial the IMS Test Number, and it decodes the real E-RABSetupResponse/cause
  code. This is the real-hardware counterpart the simulated test above explicitly cannot
  be — no software eNB simulator can reproduce a specific radio's own admission-control
  quirks (like the Nokia LMT setting that started this whole investigation).

### Added — 5G N2/N3 per-gNodeB block, mirroring the existing 4G S1-MME/S1-U block

The RAN page's per-radio Block/Unblock button was 4G-only (S1-MME SCTP/36412 + S1-U
UDP/2152 via nftables) — 5G's N2/N3 had no equivalent. Added a parallel `GnbBlockService`
using N2's real port (NGAP is SCTP 38412, distinct from S1AP's 36412) and its own isolated
nftables table (`open5gs_nms_gnb_block`, never sharing the 4G one), with its own SQLite
persistence, reconcile loop, and `/api/gnb-block` routes. N2/N3 interface cards on the RAN
page now show live Block/Unblock controls with N2/N3-specific wording and their own
confirmation modal.

### Changed — RAN page radio list: layout choice, and a real idle-UE undercount fix

Reworked the RAN page's per-radio S1-MME/S1-U/N2/N3 list, which had gotten visually
cramped once each row also had to carry a band tag, a blocked badge, a nickname editor,
and a block button. Prototyped five different layouts, kept three (Table, Collapsible
List, List + Detail Panel) after live comparison, dropped two. Layout is now a dropdown
in the page header next to "IP Plumbing", with a pin button to remember your choice as
the default for next time (stored per-browser). The Collapsible List layout defaults any
radio that already has UEs on it to expanded, rather than starting fully collapsed.

Also fixed a real undercounting bug found while building this: each radio's "UEs"
stat came from MME/AMF's own `num_connected_ues` field, which — confirmed against
Open5GS's real source (`src/mme/enb-info.c`) — is a live walk of the eNB's/gNB's
currently-attached UE-*context* list, unconditionally emptied the instant a UE goes
idle (that's structurally what idle means — no active S1AP/NGAP context). It can never
include idle UEs, despite an earlier in-repo comment claiming otherwise. Radio cards now
show the actual total (idle + connected, from the real matched UE list) as the primary
stat, with MME/AMF's connected-only count kept as a secondary annotation.

### Fixed — Major Events: new `bearer_setup_failure` category, and IMS registration desync

Added a `bearer_setup_failure` Major Event category matching MME's
`E_RABFailedToSetupListBearerSURes`/`Cause[Group:X Cause:Y]` S1AP log lines — the exact
shape behind the Nokia VoLTE investigation — with a decoded cause label (37 → "not
supported QCI value", 27 → "invalid QoS combination"). Separately fixed a real IMS bug:
P-CSCF keeps its own in-memory registration state completely separate from S-CSCF's
registrar, so restarting `kamailio-pcscf` alone (as a targeted config/route-script fix
does) silently wipes P-CSCF's view of every registered phone while S-CSCF still reports
them all as registered — a phone has no way to know, so its next call attempt hits a
403 "must register first," looking exactly like a client-side bug until Airplane Mode is
toggled to force a fresh REGISTER. S-CSCF's own usrloc is now `db_mode=1` (write-through,
persisted across restarts instead of wiped), and P-CSCF registration desync is now
actively detected.

### Also included in this release

Carried in alongside the above: the full tooltip system overhaul (click-to-open modal
replacing the old hover tooltips, every tooltip data file audited and expanded), RAN page
LTE-band tagging, a GenieACS RF-status detection fix for Baicells radios (`X_COM_
RadioEnable` confirmed as the only parameter that actually tracks live RF transmit state
on this firmware — `OpState`/`RFTxStatus` do not), a 4G "Block RAN" kill switch on the
Dashboard page, and UE block/detach now backed by a real Cancel-Location-Request tool
(same cgo-shim pattern as the hardware QCI test above) rather than a softer prior
mechanism.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.53] - 2026-08-27

### Added — Centralized "Fix All" stale-module popup

Replaced the 11 scattered per-module "install/config is out of date" banners (IMS, MMS,
VectorCore SMSC, PSTN, TWAMP, SecGW, VoWiFi) with a single global popup that appears on
login/page reload, lists every module currently out of date, and re-runs whatever
Install/Configure steps are needed with one click. Each module's Install/Configure logic
was extracted into a reusable `installX()`/`configureX()`/`getXStaleness()` function set,
orchestrated by a new `ModuleFixAllUseCase` (same layering pattern as the existing PLMN
Migration Wizard) in a fixed dependency order (IMS first — MMS/VectorCore SMSC/PSTN all
require it — then VoWiFi/SecGW/TWAMP), skipping dependent modules with a clear reason if
IMS's own fix fails rather than attempting a guaranteed cascade failure. Along the way,
found and fixed a real, universal bug: every parameterized module's Configure handler
defaulted missing input fields, so a naive re-Configure-with-empty-body would have
silently reset real per-deployment values (gateway IPs, listen addresses) back to
generic defaults — the orchestrator now always reads and reuses each module's own
last-saved config explicitly. MMS's Configure has one edge case Fix-All can't resolve on
its own (no safe default for its public IP) — surfaced to the operator with a clear
"configure manually" note rather than silently skipped. Verified the aggregation check
against real live staleness on this deployment (found 5 genuinely out-of-date modules);
the actual Fix-All run itself was not executed live this session — do a real end-to-end
run before fully trusting it.

### Added — RAN page: multiple concurrent PDU/PDN sessions now shown on one UE row

A UE with more than one concurrent session (the common VoLTE case — "internet" + "ims"
on the same UE) used to render as two separate rows. `ActiveUE` now carries a
`sessions[]` array (one entry per APN) and both the grouped-by-radio and flat table
views stack every session under a single UE row. 41 new/updated regression tests.

### Changed — Services page redesigned as a grouped table

Replaced the card-grid layout with a table grouped by section (5G Core / 4G EPC /
Shared / Osmocom / VectorCore / Tools), plus a new Tools → OpenSpeedTest row.

### Removed — Pluggable-dataplane/eUPF effort fully rolled back

A full effort to let the UPF/SGW backend be swapped at runtime (Open5GS-native vs.
eUPF vs. VectorCore SGW) was designed, built, and live-tested (including real
production traffic), but hit a real architectural blocker on this host (eUPF's
XDP-based packet interception can't see host-internal SGW-U↔UPF traffic routed via
loopback, and a second, unresolved gap kept decapsulated uplink traffic from reaching
the real internet) and was fully rolled back at the user's direction — no trace of it
remains in the codebase or on this host. See `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s Handoff Summary for
the full postmortem.

## [v2.0-beta_0.52] - 2026-08-26

### Added — Full Backup now covers every module (audit)

Full-system backup/restore audited end-to-end against the question "does this actually
capture everything needed to stand this deployment up on a brand new host." Found and
fixed a real bug: the `core-configs` category silently dropped `sepp1.yaml` (a stale
16-vs-17 core-NF list — SEPP was added as the 17th core NF a while back and this list
was never updated). Added two entirely missing categories: **SecGW Certificates**
(Security Gateway's own CA and every issued per-radio IPsec certificate/key — genuinely
irreplaceable material that had zero backup coverage) and **GenieACS** (its own
separate MongoDB database — device inventory, presets, provisioning scripts, TR-069
session history — previously excluded entirely). Expanded `optional-modules` coverage
to include every module's own NMS-side settings file: IMS, MMS, PSTN, VectorCore SMSC,
TWAMP, VoWiFi, swu-emulator, FRR source-build state, chrony, and syslog forwarding
(previously only SMS-over-SGs and VoWiFi configs traveled with a backup). Verified live
against this deployment's real data (not just a type-check) — all 8 categories,
correct item counts, including the sepp1 fix and both new categories.

### Fixed — TUN Interfaces page showed the wrong (IPv6) subnet for a dual-stack DNN's device (#29 follow-up)

A device shared by a dual-stack DNN (one `smf.yaml` session for IPv4, one for IPv6,
both pointing at the same `upf.yaml` `dev:`) could show the IPv6 subnet in the "APN /
Pool" column even though the interface's live IP is IPv4 — `tun-management.ts`'s
dev→{dnn,subnet} map was last-write-wins with no IPv4 preference, unlike the identical
guard already present in `apn-profile-usecase.ts`'s sibling code. Extracted a shared
`preferIPv4ByDev()` helper into `dnn-dev-resolver.ts`, used by both call sites. Verified
live against this deployment's real dual-stack `internet` DNN.

### Added — Automatic IPv6 /64 allocation for APN profiles (#30 follow-up)

New IPv6 CIDR math module (BigInt-based — no IPv6 arithmetic existed anywhere in this
codebase before now) plus a core-wide "IPv6 Pool" parent-prefix setting on the APN
Profiles page. A new profile can auto-allocate the next unused `/64` (and its gateway)
from that pool instead of requiring a hand-typed IPv6 subnet — the free slot is derived
live from existing profiles' own `subnetV6` values rather than a separate counter, so
deleting a profile naturally frees its `/64` back up. Also fixed a real functional gap
found while building this: a profile's `subnetV6`/`gatewayV6` fields were previously
display-only and never actually written to `smf.yaml`/`upf.yaml` at all — saving a
profile now writes a real IPv4+IPv6 session pair, matching the dual-stack pattern this
project's own live deployments already use by hand. 34 new unit tests, including one
reproducing the exact real dual-stack `internet` DNN shape to confirm the IPv4 and IPv6
sessions get patched independently and never cross-contaminate each other.

## [v2.0-beta_0.51] - 2026-08-24

### Added — TWAMP (RFC 5357 network performance testing)

New opt-in module (`ENABLE_TWAMP_MODULE`, default off) for real backhaul RTT/jitter/
one-way-delay/packet-loss testing against radio/backhaul TWAMP reflectors (confirmed
live against a real Nokia AirScale radio). Client and optional reflector/server, both
compiled from a thin Go wrapper around `github.com/ncode/twamp` at Install time:

- **Client**: on-demand and background-polled tests against any number of targets, full
  TWAMP-Control (TCP) and a hand-rolled TWAMP-Light (RFC 5357 Appendix I, connectionless
  UDP) implementation — the library only supports the former, but a real Nokia AirScale
  radio's reflector speaks only the latter (confirmed via packet capture). Bind-IP
  support via a source patch to the vendored library (no `LocalAddr` option upstream) —
  needed since this host is multi-homed across several RAN-facing subnets.
- **Reflector/server**: optional always-on service (own systemd unit) accepting inbound
  tests from a radio acting as the client, same dual-protocol support.
- **History tab**: every real test result (background poll and on-demand) is persisted
  to a new `nms_twamp_history` MongoDB collection with a user-configurable TTL retention
  index (default 30 days, 1–365 range) — deliberately Mongo-backed rather than
  Prometheus-backed like Traffic History, since this needed per-feature configurable
  retention that a single shared Prometheus instance's global retention setting can't
  give. Sortable worst-to-best-RTT summary table across all targets, per-target
  drill-down graph (auto-bucketed server-side so a 30-day view stays fast), and a min/
  max/average summary table for the selected time range under the graph.
- Reflector-side Prometheus metrics — previously only available when the Full/TCP
  protocol was enabled (the vendored library's own metrics endpoint never started
  otherwise, so a Light-only reflector's "Raw Metrics" tab was permanently empty).
  `twamp-server.go` now always starts its metrics endpoint and registers Light-protocol
  counters (active peers, packets reflected) alongside it; merged into the backend's own
  `/metrics` (already scraped by Prometheus) with a link out to Grafana.
- Targets tab redesigned from a card grid to a table.

### Fixed — TWAMP: Connected Clients table empty for Light-mode peers, Full protocol silently ignoring "disabled"

Two real bugs found via a live packet capture while investigating why the Connected
Clients table showed nothing despite a real Nokia radio actively testing against the
reflector. (1) The table only ever queried `ss -tn` for TCP peers — TWAMP-Light is
connectionless UDP, so a Light-only reflector (this deployment's actual config) could
never show a connected client no matter how much real traffic was flowing. Fixed by
having the Light reflector track its own recently-seen senders in-memory, exposed via a
small internal endpoint and merged into `/server/connections`. (2) The systemd unit
built boolean flags as `-full-enabled false` (space-separated) — Go's `flag` package
doesn't bind a following token as a bool flag's value, so this silently parsed as
`-full-enabled=true` and then aborted flag parsing on the stray `false` token entirely.
The saved config said Full was disabled; the server ran it anyway. Fixed to `-flag=value`
syntax for both boolean flags.

### Added — APN Profiles (#28-#30)

New "APN Profiles" page: per-DNN profile management (subnet/gateway for IPv4 and IPv6,
QoS/ARP defaults) built on a shared DNN↔device resolver (`dnn-dev-resolver.ts`,
extracted from the Framed Routing fix already shipped in v0.50 (#28), now also fixing
the TUN Interface page — custom-named UPF devices, not just `ogstun`/`ogstun<N>`-pattern
names, are now recognized instead of being invisible entirely (#29)). Profiles can
optionally split a DNN's pool into a static range (never touched by automation) and a
dynamic range — when set, Auto-Assign IPs clamps to the dynamic range only, even under
an explicit override, so statically-reserved addresses can never be handed out
automatically (#30). Subscriber page's DNN/APN fields (per-session form and Bulk Tools)
are now a dropdown of every known DNN — persisted profiles and derived/not-yet-saved
ones alike — with a "Custom" option, falling back to the original free-text input
unchanged on zero-profile deployments.

### Added — VectorCore SMSC (3rd SMS delivery mode)

New opt-in module (`ENABLE_VECTORCORE_SMSC_MODULE`, default off) adding VectorCore SMSC
as a third SMS delivery mode alongside SMS-over-IMS and SMS-over-SGs, shown as its own
tab on the SMS/MMS page. Kamailio S-CSCF gained a new `ROUTE_SMS_TO_VECTORCORE` mode
(mutually exclusive with the existing `BLOCK_IMS_SMS` mode) relaying SIP MESSAGE to
VectorCore's SIP/3GPP-ISC listener.

### Fixed — VectorCore MMSC/SMSC systemd unit naming collision

VectorCore MMSC's own upstream repo ships its systemd packaging file under
`systemd/vectorcore-smsc.service` — a real upstream naming inconsistency (the file's own
contents are correct, only the filename is misleading) — which collided head-on with the
actual, separate VectorCore SMSC project once both were deployed on the same host, since
both wanted the same unit name. Fixed by installing the MMSC's unit under
`vectorcore-mmsc.service` instead — a pure destination-filename rename, the unit's
content is still installed byte-for-byte as shipped.

### Added — Dashboard / Services vendor labels

Every NF/service card across the Dashboard and Services pages now shows a small
software-vendor label (Open5GS, Osmocom, Kamailio, Asterisk, strongSwan, VectorCore,
"Open5GS NMS" for this project's own code) so an operator can tell at a glance which
underlying project is actually running each function. Added VectorCore SMSC status
cards and "Manage in →" links to every Services page card that lacked one.

### Fixed — Dashboard mislabeling real Osmocom services as "Open5GS"

The Dashboard's "Network Functions" grid renders every service the backend reports, not
just the core-17 — including `osmo-stp`/`osmo-hlr`/`osmo-msc` (the SMS-over-SGs stack)
whenever that's installed, since it shares the same status list the Services page
already correctly groups under its own "Osmocom" section. The Dashboard's vendor-label
helper blanket-labeled anything that wasn't literally `mongodb` as "Open5GS", so those
three real Osmocom services were mislabeled. Fixed to recognize them explicitly.

### Fixed — SecGW: persisted PKI status displayed as live tunnel connectivity

`SecGwRadio.status` is a one-way PKI/provisioning lifecycle latch (pending → active once
a credential has ever established a tunnel; → revoked on removal) — confirmed live that
a Nokia radio physically powered off still showed status "active" (correctly latched
from an earlier connection) while `swanctl --list-sas` had already dropped it via DPD.
Real-time tunnel liveness (`tunnelActive`) is now always recomputed fresh from `swanctl`
on every status call, never persisted. Also added a per-radio `enabled` admin toggle,
independent of both PKI status and live tunnel state — disabling unloads the radio's
swanctl connection and tears down any live SA without touching its certificate/PSK, so
it can be re-enabled later without re-provisioning.

### Changed — RF Planning Tool is now opt-in

`ENABLE_RF_PLANNING_MODULE` (default off) — previously always-on like the other pure-
calculator features, this module is still in early, active development (only Phase 1 of
a planned multi-phase tool), so it's opt-in like the other alpha-stage modules. Clearly
marked "Alpha" in the UI.

## [v2.0-beta_0.50] - 2026-08-22

### Added — RF Planning Tool (Phases 1-3)

New "RF Planning" nav item (Calculator icon), default-on like the other pure-calculator
features. Built in three sequential parts:

1. **Terrain-aware propagation** — real elevation data (self-hosted SRTM1 `.hgt` tiles,
   fetched on demand from the public Mapzen/Tilezen S3 bucket and cached on-disk, with a
   graceful flat-earth fallback if a tile can't be fetched), ITU-R P.526 knife-edge
   diffraction via the Deygout multi-edge method, and Hata/COST-231-Hata empirical
   propagation models as alternatives to free-space path loss. A `Close-In` model was
   added afterward for deployments outside Hata/COST-231-Hata's valid height/frequency
   ranges (e.g. a low, ~4m/20ft CBRS tower at 3.5GHz).
2. **Multi-site projects** — persisted sites (MongoDB, `rf_planning_projects`), reusable
   across sessions, plus a "reverse planning" comparison mode: required TX power for
   every saved site against the same drawn coverage polygon.
3. **Interference/SINR, field-survey calibration, PDF reports** — multi-sector SINR
   grids with a serving-site overlay, a project-scoped table of real signal-strength
   measurements with a transparent mean-offset calibration adjustment, and PDF exports
   (`pdfkit`) of link-budget/coverage/interference/calibration results.

### Added — Speed Test Server (Traffic History)

A "Speed Test Server" header link on the Traffic History page opens a config box that
starts/stops a temporary OpenSpeedTest container directly on the core, bound to any host
IP/port (e.g. a DNN gateway like `10.45.0.1`) so a UE can run a real throughput test
against the network with no NAT/public internet involved. Grew out of a live diagnostic
session — kept as a standing tool rather than a one-off.

### Fixed — Open5GS MME: duplicate Release Access Bearers Request on SGs/CSFB TAU

Diagnosed live from a real report ("lose internet, but the connection never drops") using
trace-level core logs during an active reproduction. Root cause: `sgsap_handle_lu_reject()`
(`src/mme/sgsap-handler.c`) fires a Release Access Bearers Request twice for the same TAU
when the EPS-Bearer-Context-Status IE is present with `active_flag=0` — once via
`mme_send_tau_accept_and_check_release()`, then again via a redundant, unconditional
re-check of the identical condition further down the same function. When a UE's follow-up
Service Request (e.g. LTE/NR reselection) landed in the few-hundred-microsecond gap
between the two transactions, the S1 context rebuild could orphan whichever response
arrived second — SGW-C answered both correctly, but MME could no longer match the
response to a live context, so its own transaction timeout fired ~7s later and forcibly
tore down the whole session (killing data connectivity on a UE whose RRC/NAS looked
fine). Fixed by removing the redundant call. Shipped as a new, self-contained
build-from-source-and-patch step (`mme-dup-release-access-bearers-patch.ts`, matching the
existing `smf-late-csr-patch.ts` pattern) that runs automatically, non-blocking, on every
backend startup — not gated behind any optional module's Install flow, since MME is a
core, always-on NF. Idempotent via a commit+revision marker file, so it applies to fresh
installs on first boot and to existing deployments on their next backend redeploy.

### Fixed — Framed routing installed static routes on the wrong `dev` for custom-named DNNs (#28)

`resolveDnnDevMap()` in `subscriber-management.ts` read `dnn` off `upf.yaml`'s session
list — a field Open5GS's real UPF config schema doesn't define at all (only this
project's own UPF editor writes it, as a convenience annotation, so it can legitimately
be absent). When absent, every framed route silently fell back to the hardcoded default
device (`ogstun`), regardless of which DNN the subscriber's session actually used — not
just non-functional but a real cross-DNN mis-routing/isolation concern on deployments
with multiple DNNs on separate named TUN devices. Reported with a full root-cause
analysis and suggested fix by @megaumnick. Fixed by joining `smf.yaml` (the authoritative
source Open5GS itself depends on) against `upf.yaml` by `dnn` first, falling back to a
`subnet` join (exact match, then IPv4 CIDR-overlap for a differently-declared prefix
length — confirmed live that SMF and UPF don't always agree on prefix length for the same
DNN) when `upf.yaml` has no `dnn` at all, with a warning logged instead of a silent
fallback when nothing matches. The identical fragile pattern was also found and fixed in
`auto-assign-ips-usecase.ts`'s IMS session pool detection. 9 new regression tests cover
both, including the issue's own 4-DNN/4-custom-device reproduction.

## [v2.0-beta_0.49] - 2026-08-20

### Added — Baicells radios: PLMN mismatch + duplicate-broadcast detection (all radio types)

A radio can broadcast a PLMN that doesn't match the core network's configured
PLMN — found live on two production Baicells radios that had reverted to a
leftover PLMN (311-435) from before this deployment's migration to 001-01,
which would silently block real phones from ever attaching. `GET /api/genieacs
/devices` (Baicells), `/devices/sercomm` (Sercomm 4G), and Sercomm NR's device
list now each read the core's real PLMN straight from `mme.yaml` (the same
source `plmn-migration-usecase.ts` already treats as authoritative) and flag
`plmnMismatch` when a radio's broadcast PLMN differs — shown as a red badge on
the radio card in the UI.

A second, related bug found live the same day: a radio can have the *same*
PLMN independently enabled in two different `PLMNList` slots at once, or the
same PLMN+MME-IP pair populated in two different `MmePoolConfigParam` slots —
both invisible to any check that only ever reads slot 1 (all this project's
PLMN handling did before now), and both visibly duplicated on the radio's own
native GUI with no warning. New `duplicatePlmnEntries` scan (slots 1-6 of both
tables) catches this and shows an amber badge.

Also fixed live: Baicells `rfStatus` was computed from `X_COM_RadioEnable`,
a parameter already known (and documented) to get permanently stuck rejecting
every write except a no-op on this firmware — meaning it never reflected the
radio's real RF state. Switched to `RFTxStatus`, the device's own real
operational-state parameter.

### Added — Baicells MME Pool Table (PLMN + MME IP pairs, up to 16 rows)

Full read/write editor for the `MmePoolConfigParam` object table, reachable
from each radio's expanded card on the Baicells Provisioning tab. Unlike the
LTE Freq/Cell neighbor tables (see below), live writes to this object are
confirmed fault-free on real hardware, so this one supports Add/Remove/Save,
not just read-only display. Hard gate enforced both client- and server-side,
per explicit requirement: the exact same PLMN+MME-IP combination can never
appear in two rows — the same PLMN with a *different* MME IP (multi-MME
redundancy) remains allowed. A removed row is cleared back to the device's own
observed blank state (`PLMNID="000000"`, `MMEIp1="0.0.0.0"`) rather than
deleted outright, matching the same disable-not-delete constraint already
established for the neighbor tables. Saves diff against the caller-supplied
prior state and only write the rows that actually changed.

### Added — Baicells MME Pool Config (IPsec tunnel binding)

A second, genuinely different object (`X_COM_MmePool`, a singleton, not a
table) that binds an MME pool list to a named IPsec tunnel — confirmed live
format `"<tunnelName>:LTE_POOL_MME_LIST<n>"`, comma-separated for more than
one pool. New Enable toggle, Pool 1/2 List fields (with live connection
status), and tunnel-map field, editable alongside the MME Pool Table on the
same radio card.

### Fixed — Baicells `/refresh` never actually read the PLMN/MME-pool tables

`POST /api/genieacs/refresh/:deviceId`'s `getParameterValues` list never
included `PLMNList`, `MmePoolConfigParam`, or `X_COM_MmePool` — only the
`/devices` GET route's passive cache-read projection did. In practice this
meant the new features above only ever showed real data for a radio someone
had manually forced a live read against; every other radio read back blank
indefinitely, even after clicking Refresh, since nothing was ever asking the
device for it. Confirmed live (multiple `MmePoolConfigParam` instances read
in one `getParameterValues` call, no fault) that this table doesn't have the
same multi-instance fragility Carrier/LTECell do, so a plain bulk read across
several slots is safe here.

### Changed — Baicells LTE Freq/Cell neighbor tables: read-only, write path removed

Every write attempt against `Carrier.{n}`/`LTECell.{n}` on real hardware hit
GenieACS-internal session limits — `too_many_commits` (a configurable
GenieACS-side iteration cap, default 32, raised to 1024 with zero effect on
this table specifically) and then `too_many_rpcs` (a hardcoded 255-RPC-per-
session ceiling) — regardless of how few fields were sent, even a single
2-field write to one instance. Tracing this down also fixed a real,
independent root cause: `too_many_commits` was never a device limitation at
all, it's a GenieACS safety guard meant to stop runaway provisioning scripts,
and something was inflating the counter before any of this project's writes
even reached the device — confirmed by raising the GenieACS config value
(`cwmp.maxCommitIterations`) directly in its own MongoDB `config` collection,
which measurably changed the failure mode (from an ~100ms instant fault to a
real, hours-long series of genuine device round-trips before hitting the next
wall). That fix is real and stays. But since field count turned out not to
explain the RPC count either, this points at something structural in how
GenieACS reconciles this specific object tree with this device — the same
object tree where `deleteObject` and `getParameterNames` also failed outright
earlier in the same investigation. Given that, the neighbor tables are now
read-only by design rather than continuing to fight a GenieACS-side limit;
see `PROJECT_STATE.md` (2026-08-17/19) for the full investigation before
attempting to reintroduce a write path.

### Fixed — GenieACS default/inform provisions assumed the wrong TR-069 data model

GenieACS ships two built-in provision scripts ("default" and "inform", stored
in its own MongoDB, not in this repo) that unconditionally declare TR-098
`InternetGatewayDevice.*` paths on every connected device. This deployment's
entire radio fleet (Baicells, Sercomm 4G/5G, Nokia) is TR-181-only, confirmed
live by inspecting each device's own reported data model — none have an
`InternetGatewayDevice` root at all. Baicells (BaiBLQ firmware) hard-faults
the entire GetParameterNames/Values RPC batch if even one requested path
doesn't exist, so this was perpetually faulting on every single Inform for
all 3 Baicells radios. New `SyncGenieacsProvisionsUseCase` regenerates both
scripts on every backend startup (mirrors `SyncPrometheusConfigUseCase`'s
pattern) — GenieACS's own provisions collection lives outside this project's
git tree, so unlike everything else here it wouldn't survive a GenieACS
reinstall/reset without this.

### Changed — Page layout convention rolled out across the app

The centered pill-style tab bar + header-mounted service-control pattern
(already standard on `AutoConfigPage.tsx`) is now applied to IMS, FRR/L3
Routing, SAS, Metrics, SecGW, VoWiFi, and PSTN Gateway pages — replacing the
older left-aligned underline-tab style and, on SecGW/VoWiFi/PSTN Gateway,
moving Start/Stop/Restart out of a body card into the page header. A real bug
this surfaced: those buttons were gated on `configured` rather than
`installedOnDisk`/`installed`, so VoWiFi's controls vanished while the
service was genuinely running but not yet (re)configured — fixed on all three
pages. Radio Auto-Config is now its own dedicated nav section
(`RadioProvisioningPage.tsx`), split out of the old combined Auto Config page.
Added a dark-theme switcher (several themes) under a username-click menu in
the main navbar (`ThemeContext.tsx`, `UserMenu.tsx`). See `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s
Engineering Decision Log for the full rationale and per-page breakdown.

## [v2.0-beta_0.48] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed — PSTN Gateway audio: full duplex confirmed working (both directions, both dialing methods)

Real audio over the PSTN Gateway (Asterisk) was previously unconfirmed/broken —
signaling worked end-to-end but no audio, or one-way audio, reached either party.
Four real, independent bugs found and fixed via live packet capture, raw RTP byte
decoding, and Asterisk's own internal diagnostics (`pjsip show channelstats`, RTCP
Sender Reports). Confirmed working full duplex, both call directions, both the PSTN
extension dialing method and normal MSISDN dialing, over VoWiFi.

- **S-CSCF self-relay loop on ACK/CANCEL/BYE for any PSTN Gateway call**
  (`kamailio_scscf.cfg`). A real phone's in-dialog requests for a PSTN Gateway call
  arrive at S-CSCF with a self-referencing Request-URI and no usable Route header —
  an artifact of how `loose_route()` unwinds once only proxy-owned Record-Route
  entries remain, since the real remote target (Asterisk's Contact) was never
  carried anywhere in the request. Blindly relaying that sent the message to
  S-CSCF's own socket, which re-entered processing and repeated until Max-Forwards
  was exhausted — the actual cause of "connects but no audio" (the SDP-bearing 200
  OK's ACK hit this path) and of BYE failing with a 500 instead of reaching
  Asterisk (hanging up one leg never tore down the other). Confirmed via packet
  capture: a captured ACK growing by two new Via headers every loop iteration, 272
  self-addressed packets per call. Fixed by saving the real PSTN target via
  `$dlg_var(pstn_target)` in `route[PSTN]` and recovering it unconditionally right
  after `loose_route()`, for any method, before existing dispatch logic runs.
- **Dead rtpengine "learn Asterisk's session" guard**
  (`kamailio_pcscf/route/rtp.cfg`). A guard added to prevent double-processing an
  already-rewritten SDP (`$sdp(c:ip) != IPSEC_LISTEN_ADDR`) was silently always
  false for every Asterisk reply, because `IPSEC_LISTEN_ADDR` and
  `pjsip_pstn.conf`'s `external_media_address` happen to be the same IP for
  unrelated reasons — so this branch, meant to let rtpengine learn Asterisk's real
  address for the caller-facing leg, never ran on any PSTN Gateway call since the
  day it was added. Confirmed live via `pjsip show channelstats`: Receive stuck at
  0 for nearly a full second of continuous correct-address packet arrival. Fixed by
  replacing the IP comparison with a `$dlg_var` per-dialog idempotency flag.
- **`/etc/asterisk/rtp.conf` silently unreadable by the `asterisk` user**
  (`pstn-controller.ts`, generalizes beyond PSTN). Writing a host config file from
  inside this backend's container creates/overwrites it as `root:root` — every
  *other* Asterisk config file ships `asterisk:asterisk`, so a root-owned
  `rtp.conf` at its default `0640` mode was completely unreadable to the process
  that needed it, and Asterisk silently fell back to every compiled-in default
  instead of erroring. Confirmed live: `rtpstart`/`rtpend` reverted to the
  compiled defaults 5000/31000 instead of the file's real 10000/20000 values.
  Fixed by chowning to `asterisk:asterisk` immediately after every write, and by
  setting `strictrtp=no` on this trunk (the caller's real audio was being
  rejected by strict-RTP source validation, an inherent consequence of this
  deployment's B2BUA topology, not a spoofing attempt — acceptable here since this
  trunk has no public SIP exposure).
- **Cross-leg RTP payload-type mismatch — audio arrives but is undecodable**
  (`pstn-controller.ts`'s `pjsipPstnConf()`). The caller↔Asterisk and
  Asterisk↔callee dialogs are two unrelated SDP negotiations that each
  independently assign their own dynamic payload-type number to the same codec
  (e.g. AMR as payload type 97 on one leg, 113 on the other). Confirmed via raw
  RTP header byte decode: a caller's phone received real audio packets carrying
  payload type 113, a value its own negotiation never defined — undecodable
  despite arriving correctly on the wire, indistinguishable from "no audio" to a
  real user even though every packet-count check looked healthy. Fixed with
  `asymmetric_rtp_codec=yes` plus `codec_prefs_outgoing_offer=prefer:pending,
  operation:intersect,keep:all,transcode:allow` on the `scscf_trunk` endpoint.

See `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s newest Handoff Summary entry for the full technical
writeup, including which diagnostic techniques actually distinguished a real fix
from a false lead (raw packet counts alone were repeatedly misleading).

## [v2.0-beta_0.47] - 2026-08-14

### Added — Security Gateway (SecGW): new optional module for radio-backhaul IPsec

New optional module (`ENABLE_SECGW_MODULE`, defaults **disabled**) that terminates
IPsec tunnels from radios and forwards decrypted S1-MME/S1-U (4G) traffic to the
existing core NFs — architecturally the same "decrypt at the edge, plaintext inside"
pattern VoWiFi's ePDG already uses, built on strongSwan/`swanctl` (source-built via
`secgw-build.ts`, with a small patch so it can coexist with VoWiFi's own IKEv2 daemon
on UDP 500/4500 — see `SECGW_BIND_ADDR`). Confirmed live: 3 Baicells eNBs and 1 Nokia
AirScale radio all connected simultaneously, real S1AP/GTP-U traffic verified flowing
through the tunnel via packet capture (ESP wrapper + decrypted SCTP heartbeat to MME,
correlated by timestamp, port 36412).

Real bugs found and fixed along the way:
- **Shared pool CIDR across radios silently collided on one kernel XFRM policy
  slot** — whichever radio negotiated last stole the policy from the others, who then
  showed ESTABLISHED in swanctl but had no real traffic path. Fixed with per-radio
  dedicated single-address pools (`allocatePoolAddress()`).
- **That same pool-collision fix, when applied live to already-connected radios by
  hand-editing conf.d files directly, was never reflected back into
  `.secgw-state.json`** — so the app's own "already used" bookkeeping for new radios
  saw stale/empty `poolAddress` fields and happily handed out an address already in
  live use, nearly repeating the same outage for a newly-added Nokia radio. Fixed with
  `reconcilePoolAddressFromDisk()` — on load, any radio missing `poolAddress` gets it
  recovered from its live conf.d file's `pools{}` block (ground truth) instead of
  staying null.
- **Nokia has no IKEv2 Configuration Payload (CP) support at all** — confirmed live
  by reading the radio's own IPsec page directly, not assumed. It only exposes static
  tunnel endpoints + traffic selectors as one or more standalone "Protect" policies,
  with no virtual-IP/CP concept anywhere on the page. The Nokia config generator had
  been built as a copy of Baicells' CP+pool-address model, which meant `remote_ts`
  was set to an address the radio would never actually request — CHILD_SA negotiation
  could never have succeeded. Fixed by deriving Nokia's `remote_ts`/`remote_addrs`/IKE
  identity from the radio's own real IP (`localIpAddress`) instead, and dropping the
  `pools{}` offer entirely for Nokia connections.
- **Nokia's only identity field ("Peer IKE identity") describes what identity it
  expects FROM the gateway, not what it presents as its own** — with no separate
  field to set a custom local ID, Nokia defaults to presenting its own tunnel-endpoint
  IP (the common IKEv2 fallback per RFC 7296 when no local ID is configured). The
  gateway's `remote.id`/PSK lookup was expecting the synthetic
  `radio-xxx.secgw.<realm>` string used for Baicells — fixed to expect the radio's
  real IP instead, and to lock `remote_addrs` to that same known-static address rather
  than `%any` (Nokia's IP is known upfront, unlike Baicells which may be NATed).
- **Nokia's own PSK complexity rule rejected the auto-generated PSK** — the generator
  produced a plain lowercase hex string; Nokia's page requires 8-128 chars, 2+ digits,
  both cases, a non-alphanumeric character, no spaces/quotes, and no repeated
  character back-to-back. Added a dedicated `generateNokiaPsk()` (rejection sampling,
  verified against 50,000 generated samples) plus client-side validation so a
  manually-typed PSK is caught before submit instead of only failing on the radio.
- **Added `extraLocalCidrs`** — an "Additional Protected Destinations" field (either
  vendor) for radios that need to reach something beyond the auto-derived core NF
  pair through their tunnel, e.g. the BIND DNS server for a Nokia radio whose own
  IPsec page couldn't do a plaintext "Bypass" policy for DNS at all and needed it
  added as a real "Protect" entry instead.

Frontend: Radios tab is split into separate Baicells/Nokia sub-tabs since the two
vendors' IPsec models and field sets are fundamentally different (`RadioFormModal`
branches on vendor); Nokia's Add/Edit form uses the exact field names/spelling the
radio's own page uses (not renamed/abbreviated — e.g. "IKE association max lifetime",
not "IKE SA lifetime"); the radio Details panel shows every one of Nokia's ~19 IPsec
settings as a table with the value to enter on the radio, not a partial summary.
Dashboard gained a SecGW Tunnels stat card (active/down/total) replacing the old WS
Connections card.

Also fixed the same "always shows the first-run Install prompt, even when already
installed" bug on the VoWiFi page that SecGW's Setup tab had already been fixed for —
audited every other install-flow page (IMS, SMS, MMS, PSTN, Time Server/chrony, BIND9,
UE Validation/swu-emulator, Syslog Forwarding) and confirmed none of the others had it.

### Fixed — `nms-btn-secondary` and other phantom CSS classes silently rendered unstyled

`nms-btn-secondary` was used on 5 buttons across the frontend (VoWiFi/SecGW's
Configure buttons, a modal Cancel button, AutoConfig's Preview button, SMS's interval
Set button) but was **never actually defined** in `index.css` (only `nms-btn-primary`/
`nms-btn-danger`/`nms-btn-ghost` exist) — every one of those buttons rendered with no
color or box styling at all. A full audit of every `nms-*` class/token used anywhere
in the frontend against what's actually defined in `index.css` and
`tailwind.config.js` turned up three more of the same bug: `nms-accent-hover`,
`nms-surface-1`, and `nms-text-secondary` were referenced as Tailwind color tokens in
20+ places but never defined in `tailwind.config.js`'s `colors`, and `nms-checkbox`
was used on 11+ checkboxes across `SubscriberPage.tsx`/`SeppEditor.tsx`/others with no
CSS rule at all, meaning every checkbox in the app was an unstyled native browser
checkbox. Fixed each usage to point at the real, defined equivalent
(`nms-accent-dim`, `nms-surface-2`, `nms-text-dim`) and added a real `.nms-checkbox`
rule. If you add a new `nms-*`-prefixed class or color token, grep both `index.css`
and `tailwind.config.js` first to confirm it actually exists — Tailwind silently
generates nothing for an undefined arbitrary/custom class, it doesn't error.

## [v2.0-beta_0.46] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed — VoWiFi: real SIP signaling now works end-to-end for the first time

Root-caused a bug that made every single uplink SIP/GTP-U packet from a
real VoWiFi UE vanish silently, even after full IKEv2/EAP-AKA' attach and a
correct S2b GTP-U session establishment: vendored VectorCore ePDG's
TC-BPF uplink program tries to `bpf_redirect_neigh()` the encapsulated
frame toward the ePDG's own downlink-receive interface — but this
deployment always runs the ePDG and UPF/PGW colocated on the same host
(dummy interfaces), and `bpf_redirect_neigh()` fundamentally cannot resolve
a real L2 neighbor for a locally-owned destination, regardless of which
interface is named as the target (confirmed by also trying the real
physical NIC — same failure, via a genuine ARP timeout instead). Fixed by
bypassing the in-kernel redirect for uplink entirely: the TC-BPF program
now hands the selected TEID + raw inner packet to userspace via a
`BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF`, and a new Go goroutine delivers each one with a
plain UDP `sendto()` on the ePDG's existing GTP-U control socket — the same
ordinary local-delivery path every other process on the host already uses
successfully. Verified live: a real phone completed a full REGISTER → 401
Challenge → REGISTER → 200 OK → SUBSCRIBE → NOTIFY exchange end to end for
the first time ever against this ePDG, WiFi Calling shows Active on the
device, and a real iPhone-to-iPhone VoWiFi call works with two-way audio.
(VoWiFi-to-VoLTE calling still has an open issue — connects with audio but
drops after a few seconds on an `rtpengine` receive-queue overflow — not
yet resolved, tracked for a future session.)

Also fixed, found during the same investigation: VectorCore ePDG's
half-open IKE SA reaper called the low-level SA-map delete directly instead
of the full session teardown path, leaking permanent zombie
"EAPAuthenticated" entries into the admin API's client list every time a
half-open attach attempt timed out (one real deployment showed 4 entries
for the same IMSI, 3 of them zombies).

Both fixes are baked into `POST /api/vowifi/install` (`vowifi-build.ts`,
`VECTORCORE_PATCH_REV` bumped to 7) so they survive a reinstall, and were
verified through the real install API against a truly clean checkout, not
just a manual live patch.

### Fixed — VoWiFi install script: six real patch-application bugs, never caught until now

While baking the above in, ran the actual install script end-to-end for
what appears to be the first time since several existing patches (NAT-T
source port, `detectNAT()` SPI fix, the AAA `Authorization`/`same_apn`
Erlang patches) were originally added — and found all of them were silently
broken. Root cause: this script is generated from a TypeScript template
literal, and JavaScript string/template-literal parsing silently drops a
backslash in front of any character that isn't a recognized escape
sequence — so `\/`, `\*`, `\[`, `\]` written into the source to escape sed/
grep regex metacharacters were never actually reaching the generated bash
script as escaped, breaking sed's delimiter counting in one case (a hard
syntax error, `sed: -e expression #1, char 23: unknown option to 's'`) and
silently corrupting grep's pattern matching in the other five (patches
would apply but the very next verification step would then fail to detect
that they'd applied, aborting the whole install). Fixed by removing the
backslashes that don't survive JS parsing anyway and switching every
affected `grep -q` to `grep -qF` (fixed-string matching, sidesteps the
whole class of bug since no regex escaping is needed at all). A `\.`
(literal-dot) case in several older patches turned out to be harmless by
coincidence — an unescaped `.` regex wildcard still matches a real literal
dot — so those were left as-is. Confirmed fixed via three full end-to-end
`POST /api/vowifi/install` runs against a genuinely clean checkout, the
last one completing successfully through both the ePDG and AAA builds.

### Added — VoWiFi: "Configuration out of date" banner

VoWiFi's Configure step (`epdg.yaml`/`aaa.config`/systemd unit generation)
had no staleness tracking at all — only Install did. Added a
`VOWIFI_CONFIG_GEN_VERSION` counter and `configuredWithVersion`/
`configStale` fields (`GET /api/vowifi/status`), mirroring the existing
IMS page's `configStale` pattern: an amber-adjacent blue banner on the
VoWiFi page prompts a re-Configure whenever the generation logic changes
after a deployment was last configured, reusing the same already-loaded
form state so the operator doesn't need to re-enter anything.

## [v2.0-beta_0.45] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed — Open5GS SMF: real core-network bug causing "IMS won't create the bearer"

Root-caused live via a real Nokia AirScale Pico BTS B66 eNB attach:
`smf_gsm_state_operational()` (`src/smf/gsm-sm.c`, upstream Open5GS) silently
drops a Create Session Request that collides with an already-operational
session — no GTP2 response sent at all. The peer times out several seconds
later, and as an observed side effect of that timeout's cleanup, the UE's
other, unrelated sibling PDN session also gets torn down (a working
"internet" bearer dying just because a colliding "ims" request arrived for
the same UE). Fixed by replying immediately with
`OGS_GTP2_CAUSE_LATE_OVERLAPPING_REQUEST` (121) — the exact cause 3GPP TS
29.274 Table 8.4-1 defines for this collision — instead of silently
dropping. Confirmed live, twice: the `ims` bearer now comes up cleanly and a
real SIP REGISTER reaches P-CSCF from it.

Baked into `POST /api/ims/install`: a new step (`smf-late-csr-patch.ts`)
detects the host's own already-installed `open5gs-smfd` commit (Open5GS
isn't vendored by this NMS, so it can't pin a fixed version), checks that
exact commit out, patches it, builds it, and installs it over the host's
binary — with an automatic rollback to the pre-patch binary if the newly
built one fails to come up healthy. Verified end-to-end through the real
`POST /api/ims/install` API, not just a manual live patch.

### Fixed — IMS: DNS IP defaulted to P-CSCF's IP instead of a real DNS IP

`POST /api/ims/configure` used to default `dnsIp` to `pcscfIp` when a caller
didn't pass one explicitly — a coincidental, unrelated value. Every
subsequent Configure then merged that wrong IP into BIND's `listen-on` list
permanently (nothing ever removed it). Now defaults to whatever non-loopback
IP BIND is already configured to listen on (falling back to `127.0.0.1`),
derived from BIND's own live config instead of guessed. Also fixed the same
wrong hardcoded placeholder (`10.0.1.178`) in the frontend Configure form's
initial state.

### Added — IMS: "Reinstall available" prompt

New `installedWithVersion`/`installStale` tracking (`.ims-install.json`),
mirroring the existing `configuredWithVersion`/`configStale` pattern used
for Configure. A version bump that changes any Install-time step (a new
patch, a fixed package list, ...) now surfaces a banner prompting the user
to re-run Install — previously nothing signaled this, and worse, the
Install button itself disappears from the UI entirely once IMS is already
installed, so there was no way to even manually trigger it again.

## [v2.0-beta_0.44] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed — VoWiFi: uplink data plane never worked (root cause found and fixed)

VectorCore ePDG's `detectNAT()` compared the initiator's
`NAT_DETECTION_SOURCE_IP` hash against the just-generated responder SPI
instead of `0` — RFC 7296 §2.23 requires the initiator to compute that hash
with SPI_r = 0, since it doesn't know the responder's SPI yet at the point
the IKE_SA_INIT request is sent. Comparing against the real random SPI
instead meant the hash could never match, so NAT-T was force-enabled on
100% of sessions regardless of the real network path. Every kernel XFRM SA
was then installed expecting UDP-encapsulated ESP, while a real, non-NATed
UE correctly sent plain ESP (IP proto 50) — a guaranteed mismatch that
silently dropped all inbound traffic (`XfrmInStateMismatch`) before it ever
reached the TC-BPF forwarding program. Confirmed live: after the fix, real
phones report `nat:false`, and the eBPF uplink counters show real,
successful traffic for the first time. Two earlier, real bugs in the same
vendored source (a wrong local IP in the kernel XFRM SA, and a hardcoded
NAT-T port) were also found and fixed this cycle — both necessary but not
sufficient on their own. Downlink and real SIP registration over VoWiFi are
still not yet confirmed working.

### Fixed — FRR L3 Wizard: OSPF option was completely non-functional

The config generator emitted `router ospf <id>` — a multi-instance-OSPF
syntax FRR has since removed entirely (`ospf multi-instance` isn't even a
recognized command on FRR 10.6.1). Every OSPF apply hit
`% OSPF is not running in instance mode` and FRR silently dropped the whole
stanza, including the `network ... area ...` statement — so the neighbor
could never come up regardless of how correctly the peer router was
configured. Fixed to the process-ID-less `router ospf` form FRR actually
accepts; removed the now-meaningless "Process ID" field from the OSPF
wizard form. Confirmed live: neighbor now reaches Full state within
seconds. EIGRP and BGP were unaffected — this was OSPF-only.

### Added — IMS Live Status: split IPsec SAs into IMS/SIP vs VoWiFi tables

The kernel's `ip xfrm state` table is shared by both P-CSCF's SIP-signaling
IPsec (Gm) and VoWiFi's ePDG↔UE tunnel IPsec (SWu), with no notion of which
subsystem owns which SA. The Live Status page now classifies each SA by
matching its src/dst against each subsystem's own known bind address and
renders them as separate grouped tables.

### Fixed — VoWiFi page: stale Live Sessions rows

`clients.map(c => <tr key={c.imsi}>)` used a non-unique key — IMSI repeats
across zombie/active session rows for the same subscriber — which could
leave stale rows on screen after the underlying session list shrank. Now
keyed by array index.

### Added — Third-party credit for VectorCore

`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the README's Acknowledgments section now
credit Stacy Vinson (svinson1121) and the VectorCore Mobile project for
VectorCore ePDG, VectorCore AAA, and VectorCore MMSC, which this NMS builds
from source to power the VoWiFi and MMS backends.

## [v2.0-beta_0.43] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed — IMS Install: PyHSS Python dependency install was silently broken

`pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt` failed with
`Cannot uninstall pyparsing 3.1.1, RECORD file not found. Hint: The package
was installed by debian.` — `pyparsing` (and potentially other deps) ships
as an apt/dpkg-installed system package with no pip RECORD metadata, so pip
can't uninstall it before replacing it. The Install step printed "✅ IMS
installation complete" regardless, leaving PyHSS's real dependencies never
actually installed. Fixed by adding `--ignore-installed`, which installs
straight over the apt copy (shadowing it in site-packages) instead of
trying to uninstall first. Confirmed live: full dependency install now
completes cleanly on a real Ubuntu 24.04 host.

### Fixed — IMS Install: default_ifc.xml identity-domain patch false-failure

Upstream PyHSS's `default_ifc.xml` switched Jinja2 syntax from dot notation
(`iFC_vars.scscf_realm`) to bracket notation (`iFC_vars['scscf_realm']`),
*and* independently fixed the identity-domain bug this project's own patch
guards against (upstream now derives the SIP domain from mnc/mcc directly,
no longer referencing `scscf_realm` at all). The patch step's needle only
matched the old dot form, so a fresh clone of current upstream printed a
scary but spurious ERROR every Install. Now recognizes both syntaxes and
treats "upstream no longer uses scscf_realm at all" as success instead of a
warning.

### Fixed — IMS Remove was destructively wiping subscriber APN profiles

Removing IMS called `subscriberRepo.removeImsSessionFromAll()`, stripping
the `ims` PDN session (with its real per-subscriber QoS/AMBR/PCC-rule
config) from every subscriber's Mongo document — with no corresponding
"add it back" step on a later Install. A routine Remove→Install test cycle
silently erased `ims` sessions a subscriber restore had *just* put back,
with zero warning anywhere. IMS Remove no longer touches subscriber
profiles at all; the Remove confirmation modal's copy was also corrected
(it previously claimed this would happen).

### Fixed — MMS: MM1 MSISDN header-injection proxy could get stuck down after Sync Subscribers or Start

`vectorcore-mm1-proxy.service` (injects the `X-MSISDN` header VectorCore
needs to identify senders, since real phones don't send a usable `From`)
has `PartOf=vectorcore-smsc.service` so a real Configure-triggered restart
of VectorCore also bounces the proxy — but `PartOf=` only propagates
*stop*/*restart*, never *start*. `POST /api/mms/sync-subscribers` stops
VectorCore around its bulk SQLite write then starts it back up as two
separate systemctl calls (not a single restart, to avoid a lock race) —
the `stop` took the proxy down as a side effect, and the later bare
`start` never brought it back, silently killing MMS sending until manually
restarted. Found and fixed the same latent bug in the standalone Start
action too. Both now explicitly track and restore the proxy's own running
state instead of relying on `PartOf=` propagation.

### Added — IMS Live Status: registered users tagged with subscriber nickname

`GET /api/ims/live` now resolves each registration's IMSI from its IMPI
(`<imsi>@<ims-domain>`, per `default_ifc.xml`'s `<PrivateID>`) and looks up
the subscriber's nickname, shown as a small tag next to their identity on
the IMS page's Live Status tab.

### Changed — VoWiFi page: Service Control buttons restyled to match IMS/other pages

Cosmetic only — the larger secondary-style Start/Stop/Restart buttons are
now the same compact ghost-button style used on the IMS page and
elsewhere.

## [v2.0-beta_0.42-testing] - 2026-08-02

**⚠️ Testing build.** VoWiFi's control plane is fully replaced and confirmed
working end-to-end on a real phone; its data plane (actual voice/data
traffic over the tunnel) is confirmed **not** working yet. Do not treat this
tag as a stable release.

### Changed — VoWiFi backend fully replaced: osmo-epdg + strongSwan → VectorCore ePDG/AAA

Hard replacement, not a toggle, per explicit instruction. The old backend
(5 local Erlang patches, fwmark/nftables policy-routing scheme) is archived
intact to `archive/vowifi-osmo-epdg/` — not deleted, restorable. New backend
is VectorCore ePDG (Go, native IKEv2/EAP-AKA', XDP/eBPF+TC dataplane) +
VectorCore AAA (Erlang, forked from osmo-epdg's own lineage), both vendored
and built from source on the host. New files land at the same paths the old
ones occupied — `index.ts`'s router mount and `App.tsx`'s page import
needed zero changes.

**Confirmed working end-to-end on a real phone**: IKEv2, real EAP-AKA'
authentication, all three Diameter interfaces (SWm ePDG↔AAA, S6b SMF↔AAA,
SWx AAA↔real HSS), GTPv2-C session establishment, real IP assignment, DNS
discovery.

**Confirmed still broken**: the actual ESP/GTP-U data relay — decrypted
uplink traffic never reaches VectorCore's own TC-BPF forwarding program.
Root cause not yet found; likely inside the vendored ePDG binary's own
kernel XFRM-interface wiring, not something reachable from NMS config.

Real bugs found and fixed along the way (see `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s Handoff
Summary for full detail on each):
- Domain-doubling bug in every generated Diameter FQDN (`epc.epc...`)
- Self-signed ePDG cert missing the `keyUsage` X.509 extension
- Admin API port collision with PyHSS's own `apiService.py` (8080 → 8091)
- `nsenter` exec timeout too short for the epdg unit's own startup polling
- No Swx-capable HSS was ever wired up — added a real `ConnectPeer` for
  VectorCore AAA to `open5gs-hssd` (which has genuine, compiled-in Swx
  support), and cleaned up a stale, wrong `ConnectPeer` left over from an
  unrelated, much older experiment
- A real host/kernel networking quirk: SCTP from a non-loopback source to
  a loopback destination silently times out; fixed by giving the ePDG's
  SWm client its own dedicated loopback source IP, matching every other
  Diameter interface in this project
- A real bug in the vendored VectorCore AAA source itself
  (`aaa_ue_fsm.erl`): a raw EAP-Identity payload was being forwarded as if
  it were AKA resync data on every first-time auth attempt — patched
  directly and rebuilt
- APN name case mismatch (`ims` vs `IMS`) between subscriber provisioning
  and what real phones request — patched the same vendored source
- Removed a fwmark/nftables/policy-routing scheme carried over from the
  archived backend that was actively misrouting decrypted uplink packets
  into a dead route pointing at the old system's long-gone tun device
- A stale kernel XFRM policy conflict (`file exists` on install) from
  accumulated earlier test sessions

### Added — Full-backup module: SUCI keys, L3/DNS, and selective restore

Full audit of the backup/restore module, at explicit request:

- **SUCI keys are now backed up.** `/etc/open5gs/hnet/` (the actual SUCI/SUPI
  concealment private/public key material) was never included before — only
  `udm.yaml`, which merely references these files by path. Losing them
  permanently breaks 5G SUCI de-concealment for every subscriber using it.
- **L3/IP network config is now backed up**: `/etc/frr/{frr.conf,daemons}`
  (EIGRP config) and `/etc/netplan/60-open5gs-managed.yaml` (real physical
  interface addressing — not derivable from anything else already backed up).
- **DNS/BIND is now backed up**: `named.conf.{local,options}` and every
  zone file, covering the FQDN-based NF discovery this project's addressing
  scheme depends on.
- **Restore is no longer all-or-nothing.** Uploading a backup now runs a
  real inspect step first (parses a new per-category manifest) and presents
  a checklist before touching anything — pick exactly which categories to
  restore. L3/IP and DNS default unchecked, since restoring those onto a
  host with different network topology can break connectivity outright.
- **MongoDB backup/restore is now correctly scoped to the `open5gs`
  database.** The old code ran a bare `mongodump`/`mongorestore` with no
  `--db` filter, which blindly touched *every* database on the instance —
  including GenieACS's own DB and Mongo's internal `admin`/`config`/`local`
  system databases. Restoring those onto a different host risked corrupting
  auth/replication state for no benefit.
- Deliberately still excluded: the IMS database (PyHSS's own MariaDB — a
  separate system, reinstall + resync instead) and the PSTN Gateway
  (Asterisk config — same story).

## [v2.0-beta_0.41] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed — SMS-over-IMS: 4 real, independent bugs, confirmed working end-to-end after all four

Chased a "SMS never arrives" report all the way through the stack — each fix
revealed the next layer, and none of them alone was sufficient:

- **P-CSCF never acknowledged MO `MESSAGE` requests missing a Contact
  header.** RFC 3428 doesn't require MESSAGE to carry one (unlike
  REGISTER/INVITE), and real phones often omit it. `ims_ipsec_pcscf`'s
  `fill_contact()` rebuilds its view of the request from `t->uas.request` —
  the transaction's snapshot taken by `t_lookup_request()`, the very first
  thing `route[REQINIT]` does — so a fix has to run before that point, and
  `append_hf()` alone isn't enough either: it only queues a lump, applied
  at actual relay time, after the snapshot is already taken.
  `msg_apply_changes()` forces it to apply immediately — verified safe
  against real Kamailio 5.8.8 source (it only crashes for `SUBST_SND_*`
  lumps needing a resolved send socket; a plain `append_hf()` lump can
  never trigger that path, and nothing else runs before this point in the
  route). Fixed in `kamailio_pcscf.cfg`'s `route[REQINIT]`.
- **The RP-ACK sent back to the sender was corrupting the separate MT
  delivery sent to the recipient.** Both `$uac_req(...)` (uac module) and
  the RP-DATA builder (smsops module) are single process-wide globals, not
  per-message state — sending the RP-ACK inline via `uac_req_send()` right
  before queuing the real message for later delivery left a window for
  state to bleed across the two separate calls. The recipient's phone was
  receiving the 13-byte RP-ACK structure (zero room for actual text)
  instead of the real SMS-DELIVER body. Config was byte-for-byte identical
  to the `docker_open5gs` reference project here — a real upstream
  smsops/uac interaction bug, not something this project introduced. Fixed
  by dropping the RP-ACK entirely (the SIP 202 already acknowledges the
  sender at the transport layer).
- **`enum_pv_query()` silently dropped every message before it was ever
  queued.** The reference project's `route[SMS]` uses ENUM to decide
  "local subscriber vs. route to an external gateway via Nexmo" — this
  deployment has no real ENUM DNS delegation and no Nexmo credentials at
  all (a fully self-contained private network where every subscriber is
  local by definition), so the lookup always failed and the original
  fallback (`return 1`) just gave up with no error. This was the actual,
  direct reason nothing ever arrived — upstream of and independent of the
  two bugs above.
- **`SMSC_SERVER` had no port.** DNS only has a plain `A` record
  (`smsc.<domain>` → same IP P-CSCF listens on), so anywhere this constant
  was used as a bare URI, resolution defaulted to port 5060 — P-CSCF's
  port, not the SMSC's real 7090. S-CSCF's reg-event NOTIFY back to the
  SMSC was landing at P-CSCF and getting rejected with 404, so the SMSC's
  own local contact cache never populated and messages dropped after
  retries even once queuing worked. Fixed by baking `:7090` into the
  constant.

Confirmed live end-to-end, both directions, real phones, after all four.

### Added — SMS-over-IMS delivery poll interval is now configurable

`kamailio-smsc`'s store-and-forward queue was hardcoded to a 30-second
poll. Now configurable (1–300s) via the SMS/MMS page or
`POST /api/ims/sms-worker-interval`, preserved across Configure re-runs.

### Fixed — MMS: wrong PNG content-type token

VectorCore's well-known content-type table had `0xA9` mapped to
`image/png` — wrong on both counts, verified against the real WAP-WINA WSP
Content Type registry (`wapforum.org/wina/wsp-content-type.htm`): PNG's
real token is `0xA0`; `0xA9` actually belongs to
`application/vnd.wap.wbxml`. Any real phone sending a PNG MMS attachment
used the correct standard token, which VectorCore's decoder didn't
recognize at all (`mmspdu: unsupported content-type token 0xa0`, message
dropped). GIF and JPEG tokens were already correct — this specifically
affected PNG. Patched into VectorCore's source and baked into the MMS
Install flow (git clone → patch → build), so it applies automatically on
every install or re-install. Confirmed live end-to-end with real photos,
both directions.

### Added — MMS install-time staleness detection

MMS's Configure step only rewrites `mmsc.yaml` and restarts with whatever
binary is already on disk — it never rebuilds VectorCore, so it could
never surface a source-level fix like the PNG token patch above. Added a
separate `installedWithVersion`/`installStale` signal, distinct from the
existing `configuredWithVersion`/`configStale`, with its own banner on the
SMS/MMS page telling the operator to re-run Install specifically.

### Fixed — Dashboard: registered-UE count, dead space in stat cards

- `registeredUes` was reading S-CSCF's raw IMPU-binding count
  (`ulscscf.status`'s "Records:") — every real device registers 3 public
  identities (`tel:X`/`sip:X`/`sip:imsi@domain`) that all share one
  Contact, so 3 real phones showed as "9 registered". Fixed by dumping the
  full usrloc snapshot and deduping by Contact URI; also added a device-type
  breakdown (iPhone/Android, from each contact's User-Agent) and a new
  "Active" metric (real IPsec SA traffic in the last 5 minutes, distinct
  from merely holding a still-valid registration).
- The stats grid's paired-card columns used `grid-rows-2` (equal-fraction
  rows), which force-split a column's height evenly whenever any card in
  that row grew — leaving large dead space in shorter cards. Rebalanced the
  column groupings and switched to `flex flex-col` with `flex-1` on each
  column's last card, so columns size to their own content and any small
  residual stretch-to-match gets absorbed by growing the last card rather
  than leaving blank space.

### Added — IPsec SA cleanup (workaround for a real ims_ipsec_pcscf bug)

`ims_ipsec_pcscf`'s own stale-SA cleanup (`delete_unused_sa()`) never
actually found anything to delete — confirmed via 19/19 real REGISTER
refreshes over 6h all hitting its `ENODATA` netlink error path, while a
real UE was independently confirmed (via `ip xfrm state`) to be carrying
two full stale SA quadruplets from two different registration
generations. New backend poller (`IpsecSaCleanup`, runs every 10s)
reconciles the kernel's actual SA table against real registration
activity and safely removes anything stale, independent of the broken
upstream matching logic.

## [v2.0-beta_0.40] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed — VoWiFi's own "Rebuild" flow was actually impossible without Uninstall first

Follow-up to the osmo-epdg version bump/staleness detection above, found by
checking whether this dev host's own VoWiFi deployment (installed
2026-07-12, well before today's fix) was actually current — it wasn't, and
the buildStale banner correctly said so, but there was no real way to act
on it. Two compounding bugs:

- `VoWiFiPage.tsx`'s Setup Wizard hard-disabled the "Start Install" button
  once `installStatus === 'complete'`, with no other path back to a
  clickable state short of Uninstall. Fixed: the button (relabeled
  "Rebuild") is now clickable again whenever `buildStale` is true, with an
  inline note that rebuilding only recompiles binaries and does not disturb
  the existing SMF peer/DNS zone/dummy interface config.
- `POST /api/vowifi/install`'s handler unconditionally reset the *entire*
  persisted state to defaults on every call — including `configured`,
  `epdgIp`, `aaaFqdn`, and every other Configure-time value — even though a
  rebuild only touches compiled binaries, never the live config files. That
  forced a full Configure redo after every rebuild for no real reason,
  which is what made "Uninstall then reconfigure from scratch" look like
  the only option. Fixed: only the install-progress-tracking fields
  (`installStatus`/`installStartedAt`/`installCompletedAt`/`installError`)
  reset now; everything else carries over.

Rebuilding does not restart the running services on its own (`verifyInstall()`
only confirms the new binaries exist on disk) — both the wizard's inline note
and the top-level staleness banner now say so explicitly: Rebuild, then
Restart.

## [v2.0-beta_0.39] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed — real user-reported SMF crash: duplicate ConnectPeer + misplaced parameter: key

Two real bugs from a live `test01` bug report — Open5GS SMF failing to start
entirely with `smf_fd_init: Assertion 'rv == 0' failed` after
`fd_peer_add ... File exists`.

**Duplicate ConnectPeer entries (fatal, crash-looped SMF):**
`upsertSmfAaaPeer()` (vowifi-controller.ts) manages SMF's S6b ConnectPeer for
osmo-epdg's AAA identity, and was supposed to unconditionally strip any
existing "aaa.*" entry before writing a fresh one — but only matched
`aaa.epc.*` specifically, on the incorrect assumption that a literal
`aaa.localdomain` identity was some separately-managed placeholder this
function never writes. It's not: `aaaFqdn` is derived as `aaa.${realm}`
from SMF's own freeDiameter identity, which is still the stock
`smf.localdomain` default on any host that hasn't been through the
DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard — an entirely ordinary deployment state, not an
edge case. Re-running VoWiFi Configure with a different `s6bLocalIp` (e.g.
after changing IPs) left the previous `aaa.localdomain` entry behind
instead of replacing it, and freeDiameter hard-aborts SMF at startup on a
duplicate peer rather than warning. Fixed by matching any `aaa.*` identity —
this peer slot is exclusively owned by this function regardless of its
current value.

**`parameter:` key nested inside `smf:` (warning, silently dropped the
flag it was trying to set):** `updateSmfImsSession()` (ims-controller.ts)
was writing `no_ipv4v6_local_addr_in_packet_filter` under a `parameter:`
key nested 2 spaces inside `smf:`. Confirmed against Open5GS's own source
that `parameter:` is a top-level YAML key parsed by
`ogs_app_parse_global_conf()` against the document root
(`lib/app/ogs-init.c`), a sibling of `smf:`/`global:`/`logger:`, never a
child of any NF-specific block — SMF's own `smf:`-scoped parser has no
idea what an unrecognized `parameter` child key means and just warns
`unknown key 'parameter'`, silently discarding the whole block. Fixed to
write `parameter:` at the correct top-level location, and to migrate away
any previously-written wrongly-nested block on the next IMS Configure so
an already-affected deployment self-heals rather than accumulating a
second, still-broken copy. `removeSmfImsSession()` (the uninstall
counterpart) updated symmetrically, cleaning up either the correct or the
legacy location.

Both fixes verified against realistic reproductions of the exact reported
scenario (compiled output, not just source review) before deploying:
duplicate-IP re-Configure collapses to one clean ConnectPeer line, a
wrongly-nested `parameter:` block migrates to the correct top-level
location with the flag preserved, a fresh install inserts it correctly the
first time, and uninstall cleans up completely.

**Existing affected deployments** (like the one in the original report)
need either a manual one-time fix of the live files or to redeploy this
version and re-run Configure (VoWiFi Configure self-heals the ConnectPeer
duplication; IMS Configure self-heals the parameter: placement) — the code
fix alone doesn't retroactively repair a host's already-written config.

## [v2.0-beta_0.38] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed — VoWiFi's osmo-epdg pin was a release behind its own strongSwan plugin

Investigated after a user question about which strongSwan is used where
("Are we using strongSwan just for VoWiFi?") surfaced a real version-skew
bug: `vowifi-build.ts` builds `strongswan-epdg` from the `fix_dns_parse`
branch (a personal-fork-only branch, not on the official
`gitea.osmocom.org/ims-volte-vowifi/strongswan-epdg`), which traces back to
the `osmo-epdg-0.1.2` tag plus 8 unreleased fixes (GSUP context_id bug, auth
resync mechanism, a UE-address acquire/release crash) — but `OSMO_EPDG_TAG`
(the paired Erlang GSUP server) was still pinned to `0.1.1`, a full release
behind. Two components that speak a shared, versioned protocol (GSUP) to
each other were being built one release apart.

Not a safe drop-in bump: `vowifi-build.ts` applies 3 hand-written Erlang
source patches on top of osmo-epdg (a real fix — without it, VoWiFi sessions
ignore a subscriber's HSS-configured static IP and can hand out an address
already in use by another UE). osmo-epdg 0.1.2 added its own native
mechanism for the same underlying goal (forwarding a PDN address into the
GTP-C Create Session Request), sourced from the UE's own IKEv2 request
instead of the HSS's static IP — same destination, different source,
occupying the same struct fields our patch also touches. Reconciled by
threading a `StaticIp` parameter through the call chain so the
HSS-configured IP wins when present, falling through cleanly to upstream's
native behavior otherwise (an operator-provisioned static IP should always
be authoritative over a UE's own suggestion). Verified for real, twice: the
reconciled patch was extracted byte-exact from the actual
`buildVowifiScript()` output (not hand-copied) and run through a genuine
`rebar3 compile` + `escriptize` against real `osmo-epdg` 0.1.2 source before
being committed — clean compile, working binary produced both times.

Added build-version staleness detection for existing deployments, mirroring
`ims-controller.ts`/`pstn-controller.ts`'s `configStale` pattern but for a
from-source build rather than a templated config: `/api/vowifi/status` now
returns `buildStale` (true when a deployment's recorded
`builtWithOsmoEpdgTag` doesn't match the currently-pinned `OSMO_EPDG_TAG`,
including deployments from before this field existed). `VoWiFiPage.tsx`
shows a banner explaining a rebuild (not just Configure) is available.

## [v2.0-beta_0.37] - 2026-07-30

### Added — MMS/PSTN gated behind IMS install order, iPhone .mobileconfig download

Both MMS and PSTN Gateway are built on the assumption that IMS is present
(MMS: "SMS over IMS" is this project's default delivery path for regular
texting, so MMS working while IMS is never installed leaves a half-working
deployment; PSTN: literally built on top of IMS's Kamailio signaling chain).
Neither was previously stopped from installing out of order. Added a
two-tier gate to both (`mms-controller.ts`, `pstn-controller.ts`): Install
now requires IMS **installed** (backend 400 + frontend disabled button with
an explanatory banner — cheap check, avoids wasting a multi-minute build on
a deployment that can't work end-to-end anyway), Configure requires IMS
**configured** (PSTN already had this; MMS's existing SMS/SGs-configured
check is now joined by the same IMS check). Existing users who already have
IMS installed/configured are unaffected — both checks pass immediately.

Fixed a real regression risk found while doing this: `mmscYamlCfg()`'s
template still generated `log.level: info` — the Debug-logging visibility
bug fixed in v2.0-beta_0.36 was only ever patched on the live host directly,
never in the generator itself, so a fresh Configure (or any new user's
first Configure) would have silently regenerated the exact bug that made
MMS's earlier failures invisible. Template now generates `debug`.

Added a `.mobileconfig` (Apple Configuration Profile) download on the MMS
tab — same APN/MMSC/proxy settings confirmed working on a real iPhone in
v2.0-beta_0.36, now with editable APN name and MMSC URL fields (defaulting
to the currently-configured `mm1PublicIp`) instead of hand-editing a file.
`GET /api/mms/mobileconfig` is `requireAdmin` like every other endpoint here
— this project's global `app.use('/api', authMiddleware)` hard-401s any
unauthenticated request, so a subscriber's phone can never fetch this URL
directly regardless of route-level auth choices; the admin downloads it via
their own session and hands the file to the subscriber by any transfer
method (AirDrop/email/Messages all trigger iOS's same "Review Profile"
install flow as a direct Safari download).

A full cross-module config-clobbering audit (user-requested, covering every
optional add-on module's install/configure/uninstall flow) found the known
IMS/PSTN/MMS/SMS interaction points already safe by design (VTY-only osmo-msc
ESME, external `dispatcher.list`, BIND9 ownership discipline) — but also
found a real bug unrelated to any of this session's other changes: the Core
Config page's Zustand store can go stale (most plausibly with Core Config
open in one browser tab while IMS/SMS Configure runs in another), and
`apply-config.ts`'s unconditional 17-NF bulk Apply could then silently
delete IMS's/SMS's live `smf.yaml`/`upf.yaml`/`pcrf.conf`/`mme.yaml` patches.
Fixed: `ConfigPage.tsx` now refetches fresh `rawYaml` whenever the page
regains focus/visibility, but only when there are no unsaved local edits
(`!dirty`) — never clobbers the user's own in-progress work either. See
memory: `config-page-stale-store-clobbers-addon-patches`.

## [v2.0-beta_0.36] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed — Real end-to-end MMS confirmed working: two real bugs found and fixed

First confirmed real MMS delivery between real UEs. Two real, distinct bugs
were blocking it, both found via live packet capture + source-level
debugging of VectorCore MMSC (github.com/vectorcore-mobile/vectorcore-mmsc):

1. **VectorCore logs at Debug, ships configured at Info.** Every log line on
   the MM1 request path (`http request started/completed`, `mm1 pdu decoded`,
   `mm1 mo message conversion failed`, etc., in `cmd/mmsc/http_logging.go` and
   `internal/mm1/server.go`/`handler_mo.go`) is a `zap.Debug()` call, but
   `mmsc.yaml`'s shipped default is `log.level: info` — so a fully-received,
   correctly-formed request that VectorCore actively rejected left *zero*
   trace in its own log file. Looked exactly like the request wasn't reaching
   the application at all, even with tcpdump confirming a complete TCP
   transfer with the exact right `Content-Type`/`Content-Length`. Fixed by
   setting `log.level: debug` in the deployed `mmsc.yaml`.

2. **Real MO MMS PDUs from real phones have no usable `From` field** (WAP MMS
   spec behavior — the phone expects the network to stamp its identity via
   HTTP header enrichment, same as a real GGSN/PGW would do). VectorCore's own
   fallback (`senderAddressFromRequest()` in `internal/mm1/handler_mo.go`)
   checks for `X-WAP-Network-Client-MSISDN`/`X-MSISDN`/`X-Nokia-MSISDN`
   headers — nothing in this stack ever set them, so every real MO MMS 400'd
   with `"missing from: header missing"`, which is exactly what "Not
   Delivered" + endless client-side retry looks like.

   Fixed with a new, small dependency-free reverse proxy
   (`mm1-msisdn-proxy.go`, deployed alongside VectorCore as its own systemd
   unit `vectorcore-mm1-proxy`) that owns the real public `:8002` the phone
   connects to, resolves the sender's MSISDN from their Framed-Routing IP
   (same static-per-subscriber-IP assumption `subscriber-ip-accounting.ts`
   already relies on), injects `X-MSISDN`, strips any client-supplied
   MSISDN-family headers first (don't let a UE spoof another subscriber's
   number), and forwards to VectorCore itself rebound to loopback-only
   `:18002`. The UE-IP → MSISDN map (`ip-msisdn-map.json`) is written by a new
   `MmsMsisdnMapRefresher` (mirrors `SubscriberIpAccounting`'s `start()`/
   `stop()` shape, 30s interval) so a new subscriber or a reassigned Framed
   Route IP doesn't need a manual MMS Configure re-run.

   Written in Go rather than Node, and compiled fresh from source on every
   Configure (no `go.mod` needed — stdlib-only): a Go toolchain is already a
   hard, verified prerequisite of this exact install flow, whereas Node.js is
   NOT a documented prerequisite anywhere in this project — VectorCore's own
   web-UI build only needs Node transiently at *build* time. A Node-based
   proxy would have quietly made Node.js a new permanent *runtime*
   dependency on a fresh host that might not have it (this dev host's Node
   only existed from an undocumented, out-of-band manual install — not
   anything the install flow itself guarantees).

   Found and fixed a second real bug while building this: the initial
   `writeMmsIpMsisdnMap()` used `/^\\d+$/` (matches a literal backslash+`d`,
   never a real MSISDN) instead of `/^\d+$/` — silently produced an always-
   empty map, which the 30s refresher then used to overwrite a
   manually-verified-correct map on the live host, making the fix appear not
   to work at all on the first real retest.

`mms-controller.ts`'s `/configure` now deploys/enables the proxy alongside
VectorCore on every Configure re-run (script + systemd unit regenerated each
time), and `/uninstall` tears it down too. `/status` reports `proxyActive`.

## [v2.0-beta_0.35] - 2026-07-30

### Changed — SMS over IMS confirmed as the default/primary delivery path

Following a real investigation (see the SMS Delivery Mode toggle added in
v2.0-beta_0.34): SMS-over-IMS is confirmed as the deployment default —
real phones prefer it whenever IMS-registered regardless of whether SGs is
also configured, so IMS-primary matches actual UE behavior rather than
fighting it. `configureIms()` and `/status` in `ims-controller.ts` already
defaulted fresh/unconfigured deployments to `'ims'` — no code change was
needed for a fresh install to replicate this baseline automatically, only
confirmation. Live deployment switched back to `'ims'` (was left on `'sgs'`
after v2.0-beta_0.34's investigation).

SMS-over-SGs remains available as an opt-in, experimental alternative via
the same toggle — real two-UE SGs delivery still has an open, unresolved bug
(P-CSCF's `ims_ipsec_pcscf` failing to relay a locally-generated reply back
through the IPsec tunnel; same error signature as the separate, already-known
Android→iPhone PRACK issue). SMS/MMS page's delivery-mode card updated to
label IMS as "(default)" and SGs as "(experimental)" so this isn't presented
as two equally-supported options.

Clarified in `CLAUDE.md`'s feature table: MMS's WAP Push delivery (via
osmo-msc's SMPP interface) is completely independent of this toggle — it
stays wired up and functional regardless of whether regular SMS texting is
using IMS or SGs. This was already true architecturally, just not
documented clearly enough to avoid a future "why does MMS use SGs but SMS
uses IMS" confusion.

## [v2.0-beta_0.34] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed — PyHSS "None" domain corruption regressed on every plain IMS Configure

The `sip:<msisdn>@None` identity-corruption bug (first fixed 2026-07-27) was
recurring: the fix only ever patched the *deployed file* during `POST
/api/ims/install`'s streamed script, but `configureIms()` — called on every
plain Configure, per this project's "full rewrite every time" convention —
writes `defaultIfcXml()`'s original template fresh via `fs.writeFileSync`
with no equivalent patch, silently re-introducing the exact same bug on the
next Configure. Root-caused live this session via real SIP MESSAGE traffic
(`Orig user is [sip:15550000004@None]`, `could not resolve hostname: ""`),
confirming a real subscriber's IMS SMS was failing because of it.

Fixed properly this time: `defaultIfcXml()`/`defaultShUserDataXml()` now
embed the already-known, static `imsDomain` as a literal directly, instead
of `{{ iFC_vars.scscf_realm }}` (a per-subscriber DB column PyHSS nulls on
every deregister). This removes the runtime DB dependency entirely — no
per-subscriber field to null, so Configure can no longer regress this no
matter how many times it runs. Verified live: after a kamailio-scscf
restart, both real test iPhones re-registered with clean identities
(`sip:...@ims.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org`, not `@None`).

### Added — SMS/MMS page: SMS delivery mode selector (SMS over IMS vs SGs)

Real phones prefer SMS over IMS (SIP MESSAGE) whenever they're IMS-registered
— confirmed live this session, this is why "SMS over SGs isn't working" often
actually meant "SGs was never being exercised at all, the phone used IMS
instead." New toggle on the SMS/MMS page's SMS (SGs) tab lets an operator
force SGs-only delivery: selecting it hard-rejects SIP `MESSAGE` at S-CSCF
(`403 SMS routed via SGs only`) before any ISC/iFC processing, rather than
just removing the smsc iFC — confirmed live that removing the iFC alone is
insufficient, since an unmatched MESSAGE just falls through to ordinary
registrar-based peer-to-peer delivery instead of being blocked. New backend:
`setSmsDeliveryMode()` + `POST /api/ims/sms-delivery-mode` in
`ims-controller.ts` (lightweight — only touches the S-CSCF include file and
restarts that one service, not a full IMS Configure); mode persists across a
plain Configure re-run the same way other IMS state does.

## [v2.0-beta_0.33] - 2026-07-29

### Added — Dashboard IMS Status card: live + durable call volume

The Dashboard's IMS Status card is now split (horizontal divider) into a top
half (unchanged: enabled/stopped state, registered count, IPsec SA count)
and a new bottom half showing **active calls** and **total calls placed**.

Active calls comes straight from S-CSCF's own `dialog_ng:active` stat, but
`dialog_ng:processed` (its cumulative counter) resets to 0 on every
kamailio-scscf restart — which happens often in this project (every IMS
Configure click, plus any ad hoc restart). A "total calls placed" figure
sourced directly from that stat would silently drop back to near-zero any
time an operator reconfigures IMS, which isn't what "total" should mean.

Added a small backend-side background sampler, `ImsCallStatsMonitor`
(`application/use-cases/ims/call-stats-monitor.ts`, mirrors the existing
`GtpBandwidthMonitor` pattern: `start()`/`getLatest()`, 5s interval),
that polls `dialog_ng:` every 5s and persists a delta-accumulated
cumulative total to `/etc/open5gs/.ims-call-stats.json` — if the polled
`processed` value is lower than last seen, that's treated as a restart
(the new value is added directly rather than clamped to zero), so the
total survives across restarts instead of resetting. Exposed via a new
`GET /api/ims/call-stats` endpoint; the Dashboard polls it every 5s, same
pattern as the existing GTP bandwidth card.

## [v2.0-beta_0.32] - 2026-07-29

### Added — IMS page: Live Status tab (IPsec SAs, registered users, active calls)

A new "Live Status" tab on the IMS/VoLTE page, reading directly off the
running system on every load (auto-refreshes every 5s, toggleable) — no
database involved for any of it:

- **Registered users**: dumped from S-CSCF's own live registrar via `kamcmd
  ulscscf.snapshot` (its usrloc is `db_mode=0`/in-memory only, so this is
  the only way to see current registrations at all). Groups by Call-ID so
  one real device shows as one row with all its IMPU aliases together
  (PyHSS's Implicit Registration Set gives each device 3 aliases in this
  deployment — confirmed live, 9 raw records for 3 physical phones — showing
  those as 9 separate rows would have been actively misleading).
- **IPsec Security Associations**: parsed from `ip -s xfrm state`, including
  live byte/packet counters per SA — the same signal this project's own
  VoLTE debugging has relied on throughout its history to tell "registered"
  from "actually exchanging traffic." A 0-packet SA is highlighted.
- **Active calls**: from `kamcmd dlg2.list` (S-CSCF's active dialogs).

Backend adds a small generic parser (`infrastructure/system/kamcmd-parser.ts`)
for kamcmd's semi-structured `Key: Value` / `Key: { ... }` text output,
reusable by any future feature that needs to query kamcmd rather than
hand-writing a regex per command.

## [v2.0-beta_0.31] - 2026-07-29

### Added — IMS and PSTN Gateway now detect a stale config after an upgrade

If you `git pull` a newer version onto a host where IMS and/or PSTN Gateway
were already configured, the running services keep using whatever config
was deployed by the *old* version until someone clicks Configure again —
this has always been true (config generation is a full rewrite on Configure,
not an incremental patch, so template fixes only land when Configure
actually runs), but there was previously no way to tell from the UI that
this had happened.

Both modules' Configure step now records the app version that generated the
live config. The IMS and PSTN Gateway pages compare that against the
version the backend is currently running and show a dismissible-by-fixing
banner — "Configuration out of date... click Configure to redeploy" — when
they differ, including for deployments configured before this feature
existed (no recorded version at all is treated as stale, since there's no
way to know what template they're actually running).

**Deliberately not automatic.** Configure restarts live Kamailio/Asterisk
services, which disrupts anything currently registered or on a call — doing
that silently on every backend upgrade, with no operator control over
*when*, was judged worse than a clearly-labeled banner the operator acts on
at a time of their choosing.

Verified end-to-end against the actual pre-existing deployment on this host
(configured by v2.0-beta_0.30, before this field existed): `/status`
correctly reported `configStale: true` for both modules, and clicking
Configure (via the real API endpoints, not a simulation) flipped it back to
`false` with all services confirmed healthy afterward.

## [v2.0-beta_0.30] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed — Android VoLTE as callee: real UE-to-UE calling now works iPhone↔Android, both directions confirmed with audio

Root cause found and fixed: Android's own SIP/SDP validator (confirmed on a
real Pixel 7, Samsung/Shannon modem) was rejecting any INVITE offering ICE
candidates (`a=candidate`/`ice-ufrag`/`ice-pwd`) with a bare `400 Bad
Request` — independent of whether ICE itself was ever going to be used.
This is not a 3GPP VoLTE convention (real cellular IMS doesn't use ICE at
all); this project's rtpengine offer/answer flags forced it unconditionally
for every call, inherited byte-for-byte from the `docker_open5gs` reference
implementation this module was built from, and had simply never been tested
against a real Android device before.

**Fix**: for real UE-to-UE calls only (the IMS Test Number bot is
untouched), `kamailio_pcscf/route/rtp.cfg` now swaps `ICE=force` to
`ICE=remove` on both the offer and the answer flags. Confirmed live on real
hardware: iPhone↔Android now rings and connects with full audio in both
directions.

Two smaller, related fixes landed in the same file as part of this
investigation (found via a byte-for-byte diff against `docker_open5gs`):
a dropped `$sdp(c:ip) != RTPENGINE_IP` guard was restored, and the
Asterisk-B2BUA-offer branch is now correctly scoped to only fire for actual
Asterisk calls (previously fired on every direct-IMS call too). Neither of
these alone fixed the Android issue, but both are real correctness fixes
worth keeping.

**Two new, separate, still-open issues found while verifying this fix** —
not regressions from this change, but real bugs surfaced by testing all four
call directions live:
- Android→iPhone calls still don't complete: they stick at `183 Session
  Progress` and get cancelled after ~11s. Root cause: a P-CSCF socket
  bug in the PRACK in-dialog relay path (`udp_send(): ... Invalid argument`,
  `ipsec_forward(): Error filling in contact data`) — unrelated to ICE,
  `rtp.cfg` has no PRACK routing logic. Not yet fixed.
- PSTN Gateway (Asterisk) calls still have no audio. Traced precisely this
  time via live RTP relay tracing: Asterisk's *first* dialog leg
  (caller↔Asterisk) relays real audio correctly; the *second* leg
  (Asterisk↔callee) is stuck in a self-referential loop inside rtpengine
  and never reaches either endpoint. The guard-restoration fix above did
  not resolve this — it needs its own investigation.

See `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s Known Issues §1/§2 for the full live-call traces
and technical detail behind all of the above.

### Verified — a fresh Install/Configure reproduces this exact setup

Explicitly confirmed end-to-end, not just asserted: rebuilt the backend
container from the fixed source, then called the real `/api/ims/configure`
and `/api/pstn/configure` endpoints (the same ones the UI calls) against
the already-running deployment. Diffed every regenerated Kamailio config
file against the fixed templates — byte-for-byte identical. All IMS/PSTN
services confirmed healthy afterward. A new install, or an existing
deployment clicking Configure again, now deploys this exact fix
automatically.

## [v2.0-beta_0.29] - 2026-07-28

### Status — IMS UE-to-UE calling

Confirmed working: real UE-to-UE VoLTE calling over the local IMS core,
**iPhone-to-iPhone only**, on PLMN 001-01. **Android VoLTE support is still
in progress** — not yet working as of this release.

### Added — PSTN Gateway module (v1, **beta**)

New optional add-on module wiring **Asterisk** into Kamailio S-CSCF's
existing BGCF/MGCF-style PSTN dispatcher as a gateway, following the same
Install/Configure/lifecycle pattern as every other optional module (IMS,
SMS, VoWiFi). Covers the **internal** use case only: any dialed number that
isn't a currently-registered subscriber routes to Asterisk, which looks it
up in a new extension→subscriber mapping table and originates a fresh call
back into the core to the mapped subscriber — a real end-to-end test of the
exact signaling/media path a live SIP trunk would use, without one.

**This is beta and has no public SIP trunk connectivity.** There is no
provider integration (Twilio, Telnyx, or similar) and no inbound DID
handling in this release — calling an extension only reaches another
subscriber on this same core. The PSTN Gateway page now shows a permanent
"Beta" badge and warning banner reflecting this; the nav sidebar already
tagged it BETA. `ENABLE_PSTN_MODULE` defaults to **disabled** (unlike every
other module, which defaults enabled) — this is the first module where a
bug or misconfiguration could eventually cause real-world billing on a
linked trunk account once one exists, so it's opt-in even in beta.

Getting real audio working end-to-end surfaced a genuinely deep architecture
gap and several real bugs, all fixed:

- **rtpengine only ever saw half of each of Asterisk's two split dialogs.**
  A direct real-UE-to-UE call is one shared SIP dialog/Call-ID all the way
  through P-CSCF, so the existing offer/answer handling in
  `kamailio_pcscf/route/rtp.cfg` already gave rtpengine both halves it
  needs. Asterisk is a real B2BUA — every PSTN Gateway call is actually two
  separate dialogs with different Call-IDs (caller↔Asterisk,
  Asterisk↔callee), and each one independently needs its own complete
  offer+answer pair. Two previously-abandoned code paths were restored (with
  the specific issues that got them abandoned understood and avoided this
  time) to give both dialogs what they need — confirmed via packet capture
  and direct RTP-payload decode (bit-parsed real AMR-WB frames from the wire
  and decoded them with a real decoder) that this was the actual remaining
  gap, not a codec/timing/delivery issue.
- **Asterisk's own `bridge_native_rtp` technology** was silently breaking
  one leg's audio during live bridging — fixed with
  `bridge technology suspend native_rtp`, reapplied on every Asterisk
  (re)start.
- **I-CSCF had zero in-dialog request handling** — hard-rejected any
  PRACK/UPDATE/in-dialog BYE routed back through it with a 406, which only
  affected Asterisk-originated legs (real UE-to-UE calls never transit
  I-CSCF). Fixed with `has_totag()` + `loose_route()` + `t_relay()`.
- **Asterisk was advertising its raw loopback address** (127.0.1.4) in its
  own SDP instead of a UE-reachable one — fixed via `external_media_address`
  + `rtp_symmetric` on its PJSIP transport.
- Real-phone testing (Pixel 7 + iPhone) found and fixed 3 S-CSCF routing
  bugs: real dialers never prefix extensions with "+", `enum_query()`
  hard-errors on non-E.164 input instead of failing gracefully, and the
  Request-URI domain needed normalizing before subscriber/iFC matching for
  calls Asterisk originates back into the core.

writeup.

### Fixed — IMS Install could silently fail on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 host

Found from a user's actual fresh-install log on a real (non-dev) Ubuntu
22.04 host — none of these had ever surfaced on this project's own 24.04 dev
host:

- **`rtpengine` isn't in Ubuntu 22.04's official repos** (only from 23.04
  onward) — `apt-get install` failed with `E: Unable to locate package
  rtpengine`, and because it lived in the same install command as
  `dpkg-dev`/`mariadb-server`/etc., apt's refusal to install *anything* from
  a command line containing one unlocatable package silently took every
  other package down with it too (explaining an unrelated-looking
  `dpkg-source: not found` later in the same log). Fixed: rtpengine now
  installs as its own isolated step, falling back to the
  `ppa:davidlublink/rtpengine` PPA (package name `ngcp-rtpengine`) on
  Ubuntu versions that lack the official package, with a compat symlink so
  every other Install/Configure/Start/Stop/Restart/Status/Uninstall route's
  existing `rtpengine-daemon` service name keeps working unchanged.
- **`gpg --dearmor` failed on a second Install attempt** — refused to
  overwrite the already-existing keyring file without an interactive
  prompt, which can't be answered over this streamed, non-tty process
  (`cannot open '/dev/tty'`). Fixed with `--yes`.
- **`pip3 install --break-system-packages` broke on older pip** (the flag is
  PEP 668-specific, only understood by pip ≥ 23.0.1) and the step reported
  success unconditionally regardless of the actual outcome. Fixed: tries
  with the flag first, falls back without it only if that specific flag is
  what's unrecognized, and now only reports success when it actually
  succeeded.
- **Two PyHSS patch scripts (`diameter.py`, `default_ifc.xml`) were missing
  `set -e`**, so a real patch failure (e.g. upstream PyHSS's source no
  longer matching the expected anchor text) got silently masked by a
  trailing, unrelated validation command that succeeded regardless — the
  install log could show the real `ERROR: ... not found` line immediately
  followed by a false `✅ ... patched.`. Fixed by matching the already-correct
  `set -e` pattern the `cdp.so` patch script used.

See memory `ims-install-script-ubuntu2204-fixes` for the full writeup.

### Added — Dashboard: Asterisk + P/I/S-CSCF service status

The Network Functions section on the main Dashboard now shows live
service-status tiles for Asterisk and all three IMS Kamailio components
(P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF), matching the same status pattern used for the
core 17 NFs.

### Upgrading an existing IMS or PSTN Gateway deployment

This release's Kamailio-side fixes (the rtpengine dual-dialog fix, the
I-CSCF in-dialog handling fix) live in config **templates**, which only get
redeployed to the host when you click **Configure** — there is no
background/automatic config push in this project. If you already have IMS
installed and configured from a previous version:

1. On the **IMS** page, click **Configure** again (redeploys
   `kamailio_pcscf/route/rtp.cfg` and `kamailio_icscf/kamailio_icscf.cfg`,
   and restarts the four Kamailio services — brief, real signaling
   disruption to anything currently registered/in-call).
2. If you also have the **PSTN Gateway** module installed, click
   **Configure** (or **Restart**) on that page too, so Asterisk regenerates
   its PJSIP config with the media-address fix and re-applies the
   `native_rtp` bridge suspension (a per-process runtime setting that does
   not survive an Asterisk restart on its own).

A fresh Install on a new host already picks up everything automatically —
this step is only needed for upgrading a deployment that was configured
before this release.

## [v2.0-beta_0.28] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed — PyHSS could corrupt a subscriber's SIP identity to "None" (mistaken for a phone bug)

A recurring call failure previously attributed to the phone itself (a raw
INVITE/REGISTER showing `sip:<msisdn>@None` as the caller's own identity,
"fixed" by toggling Airplane Mode) was fully root-caused: it was never a
phone bug. PyHSS's own `/opt/pyhss/default_ifc.xml` (a third-party template,
not part of this repo) built every subscriber's `<PrivateID>` and two of the
three `<PublicIdentity>` elements from `scscf_realm` — a *transient*
Diameter-routing DB column that `database.py`'s `Update_Serving_CSCF()`
explicitly nulls out on every deregister. A race between a deregister SAR
and the following register SAR could bake the literal string `"None"`
straight into the subscriber's Implicit Registration Set (Jinja2 renders a
raw Python `None` as the text "None"), which S-CSCF then cached until the
next full re-register — exactly matching the "genuinely intermittent"
symptom.

Fixed by deriving the domain from `mnc`/`mcc` (set fresh on every render,
never touched by the deregister-clearing bug) instead of `scscf_realm`,
matching the same domain-construction pattern already used elsewhere in
PyHSS. Verified via a direct Jinja2 render with `scscf_realm=None` explicitly
passed. Baked into `POST /api/ims/install` (idempotent, self-verifying —
actually renders the template and parses the resulting XML before declaring
success) alongside the two PyHSS Cx UAA/LIA crash-guard fixes from
`v2.0-beta_0.27`, so existing deployments just need to re-run Install. See
memory: `ims-pyhss-none-domain-corruption`.

## [v2.0-beta_0.27] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed — PyHSS Cx UAA/LIA crashes on a missing identity AVP (mimicked "intermittent" failures)

While investigating a real-world call failure, found that PyHSS's own
`/opt/pyhss/lib/diameter.py` (a third-party file installed under `/opt/pyhss`,
not part of this repo) could silently crash mid-response in two Cx answer
builders:

- `Answer_16777216_302()` (Location-Info-Answer): a missing AVP 601
  (Public-Identity) in the request raised an `IndexError` before `username`
  was ever assigned; the `except` handler then referenced that same
  unassigned `username` for a Redis metric label, raising a second, uncaught
  `UnboundLocalError` from inside the handler itself. The function died
  before writing either the success AVP or the proper `5001`
  Experimental-Result-Code AVP — on the wire this looked exactly like a
  "genuinely intermittent" LIA with no result code present at all.
- `Answer_16777216_300()` (User-Authorization-Answer — the *first* Cx message
  in registration): the identical bug shape, with `imsi` instead of
  `username`, triggered by a missing AVP 1 (User-Name).

Both fixed by initializing the id variable to `None` before the `try` block
and guarding the metric-label expression against `None`. The fix is now baked
into `POST /api/ims/install` in `ims-controller.ts` (same idempotent,
exit-code-checked patch style already used for the `cdp.so` process-slot
patch) — it re-applies on every Install run, so any existing deployment picks
up the fix just by re-running Install, no separate migration needed. See
memory: `ims-pyhss-uaa-lia-crash-guard`.

## [v2.0-beta_0.26] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed — Real UE-to-UE VoLTE calling now works end-to-end (confirmed on real iPhone hardware, PLMN 001-01)

Two real registered iPhones can now call each other directly and the call
actually rings and connects — this previously only worked calling to/from the
IMS Test Number bot ([[ims-echo-test-bot]]), never between two real phones.
Root cause was multi-layered; all of the following were found and fixed:

- **RFC 3312 precondition deadlock**: two real phones calling each other never
  completed the RFC 3312 precondition handshake (neither side ever sent the
  confirming in-dialog `UPDATE`), so the call stuck forever at `183 Session
  Progress` and the caller eventually gave up and cancelled. Fixed by
  stripping `a=des:qos`/`a=curr:qos` SDP lines for genuine UE-to-UE calls only
  (the IMS Test Number bot's own precondition handling is untouched).
- **RFC 4028 session-timer header mismatch**: the callee's `183` demanded
  `Require: 100rel,timer`, but real iPhones never declare `timer` support in
  their own `PRACK` — fixed by stripping `timer` from `Require` on the same
  UE-to-UE-only path.
- **The actual root cause: no P-CSCF↔PCRF Rx interface, so no dedicated QCI=1
  (GBR voice) bearer was ever created for a call.** Real iOS's own
  "precondition" logic is tied to an actual dedicated bearer coming up, not
  just SDP attributes — the two fixes above only ever moved the failure point
  later. The full Rx interface (`ims_qos`/`cdp`/`cdp_avp` Kamailio modules,
  PCRF-side wiring, Diameter peer XML) had already been built in an earlier
  session but was left fully disabled behind one commented-out
  `##!define WITH_RX` line — activated it, and the whole
  offer→Rx-AAR→Gx-RAR→dedicated-bearer chain now works.
- **A Diameter connection-collision bug**, found only after activating Rx:
  both P-CSCF and PCRF were configured to actively connect to each other
  simultaneously, and Kamailio's `cdp` module's collision handling for that
  case is broken in practice — produced an endless connect/disconnect flap
  that silently blocked all call signaling. Fixed by making P-CSCF
  accept-only for the PCRF peer (removed its own outbound `<Peer>` element).
- **Stale PLMN entries in PCRF's `pcrf.conf`** (left behind by earlier PLMN
  changes, same underlying bug class as the known FRR stale-neighbor-list
  issue) were confirmed to actively interfere with the real Rx connection.
  `upsertPcrfPcscfPeer()` now cleans up every old entry on each Configure run.

No separate migration is needed for existing installs — `configureIms()` is a
full-rewrite of every IMS config file on every "Configure" click (fresh
install or re-run), and already unconditionally restarts both
`kamailio-pcscf` and `open5gs-pcrfd`, so re-running Configure on the IMS page
picks up every fix above automatically.

**Known real limitation, not a software bug**: dedicated QCI=1 bearer setup
was confirmed rejected outright by a specific real eNB model (S1AP cause
`not-supported-QCI-value`) — confirmed by cross-testing the same call against
a different radio, which succeeded. If a UE-to-UE call still won't ring after
all of the above, check the serving eNB's own S1AP `E-RABSetupResponse`
before suspecting a core-network bug.

See memory: `ims-ue-to-ue-calling-investigation` for the full debugging
record.

## [v2.0-beta_0.25] - 2026-07-24

### Added — Traffic History (GTP U-Plane throughput over time, aggregate + per-subscriber)

New **Traffic History** page charting Up/Down Mbps over 24h/7d/30d ranges at
5m/15m/1h resolution, filterable to a single subscriber by IMSI. Rather than
building a new time-series store, this reuses the Prometheus + Grafana stack
already running in this project (`open5gs-prometheus`, 30-day retention,
already scraping every NF's own metrics endpoint): the backend now exposes
its own `/metrics` endpoint with raw cumulative counters
(`open5gs_gtp_{rx,tx}_bytes_total{dnn}` from the UPF tun devices,
`open5gs_subscriber_{up,down}_bytes_total{imsi}` from a new nftables-based
per-subscriber accounting module, `subscriber-ip-accounting.ts`), and
`prometheus.yml` is now regenerated on every backend startup (not only on
"Apply Config") so upgrading installs pick up the new scrape job
automatically. The REST API is a thin proxy translating the page's filters
into a PromQL `query_range` call — Prometheus owns storage, retention, and
rate computation, not custom code.

### Fixed — UE Validation (4G): srsRAN Docker image was never actually built anywhere

`srsran4g-noavx` is a locally-built-only image (from `srsran4g/Dockerfile` in
this repo) — the backend only ever attempted a `docker pull` on it, which
always fails (nothing by that name is published), silently logged as a
warning, then fell through to `docker run`, which failed too since the image
had never been built. This surfaced as a fatal `pull access denied` /
`Unable to find image` error on any host that hadn't manually pre-built the
image outside the app. Fixed: the backend now checks whether the image
exists locally and builds it from the (now correctly volume-mounted)
`srsran4g/Dockerfile` if not, failing fast with a clear error if the build
itself fails. Measured a real first-time build at ~22 minutes on a cold
Docker layer cache, so both the backend's build timeout and the frontend's
session status-poll cutoff (previously 10 minutes, would go stale mid-build)
were extended well past that.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.24] - 2026-07-24

### Added — Subscribers: bulk delete, and a single merged Bulk Subscriber Tools card

Selecting subscribers now shows a "Delete selected" action alongside the
existing group actions, with a confirmation prompt and a per-subscriber
success/failure summary. Separately, Auto-Assign IPs, Auto-Assign MSISDN, and
Bulk Add APN — previously three separate dialogs — are now one "Bulk
Subscriber Tools" card with a section per tool (each independently
enable-able) and a shared scope control: run against all subscribers, or
against a specific selection via a self-contained searchable picker
(independent of the main table's row checkboxes, though seeded from them).

### Fixed — Auto-Assign IPs/MSISDN: gaps between existing blocks silently collided instead of being filled

Both tools used a bare incrementing counter that only skipped a subscriber
who already had a value — it never checked whether the *candidate* value was
already held by someone else. If, say, the first 5 and last 5 of 20
subscribers already had sequential IPs/MSISDNs assigned from a prior run, a
fresh run over the middle 10 would silently reuse the first 5's values,
producing duplicate IP/MSISDN assignments. Both now build the full set of
already-in-use values across all subscribers (not just the ones in scope)
and skip over them while walking the range, correctly filling gaps instead of
colliding with existing assignments.

### Added — Dashboard: GTP U-Plane bandwidth card, Primary PLMN card

New live Up/Down Mbps card sampling the UPF's per-DNN tun device byte
counters (`ogstun`/`ogstun2`, discovered from `upf.yaml` rather than
hardcoded) every 2s in the background — these interfaces carry nothing but
decapsulated UE payload, so this is genuinely "GTP traffic only," with zero
risk of counting S1AP/NGAP/PFCP/Diameter signaling that happens to share a
physical NIC. Also added an AMF/MME Primary PLMN display (split into its own
two-row section) — was previously showing dashes only because
`ConfigMapper.toAllDto()` returns the raw YAML for every service including
its own top-level wrapper key (`{amf: {amf: {...}}}`, not `{amf: {...}}`),
which the dashboard's original lookup path didn't account for.

### Documented — SAS page: Sercomm 5G NR SAS endpoint (port 8899)

Added a third endpoint card to the SAS Dashboard tab specifically for
Sercomm 5G NR gNBs (`http://<host>:8899/sas`) — this radio family sends
Host-less HTTP/1.1 SAS requests that nginx rejects before routing, so it
needs the dedicated plain-HTTP proxy the backend already runs on port 8899,
not the general 8888 endpoint or the 8443 HTTPS one (which is for other
radios that behave correctly over TLS, e.g. Sercomm 4G femto/FreedomFi).

### Documented — INSTALL.md: build-from-source path for the MongoDB AVX workaround

Hosts without AVX CPU support (common on some virtualized/older hardware)
can't run MongoDB 5.0+ on the host and need `mongo_docker/`'s Dockerized
MongoDB instead — but that means `apt install open5gs` hangs on its own
MongoDB dependency check, which wasn't previously connected to the existing
"build from source" instructions. Clarified that this path requires building
Open5GS from source instead of `apt install`, and confirmed via Open5GS's own
`meson.build` that the existing `--sysconfdir=/etc` flag (already present in
the from-source instructions) is correct and necessary for YAML configs to
land in `/etc/open5gs` rather than meson's `/usr/etc/open5gs` default.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.23] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed — PLMN Migration Wizard: NRF serving PLMN was never migrated

`nrf.yaml`'s own `nrf.serving.plmn_id` list — the PLMN(s) NRF will accept
NF registrations/discovery for — was never touched by any prior migration,
on any past run. Found stuck on a stale value that matched neither the
pre- nor post-migration PLMN. `applyPhaseA()` now rewrites it via the
existing `replacePlmnId()` helper (same array shape as `amf.plmn_support`),
and Phase E verification now checks it (`nrfOk`). Verified live via a real
Phase A→E apply.

### Fixed — DNS Migration Wizard Phase C: spurious "HTTP 000" SBI reachability failures

The post-restart SBI reachability check (`curl --http2-prior-knowledge` against
each NF's FQDN) ran via `executeLocalCommand`, which executes inside the
*backend container's own* network namespace. The container's
`/etc/resolv.conf` is Docker's auto-generated default (`1.1.1.1`/`8.8.8.8`)
and never routes through the host's BIND server — unlike the host's own
resolver, which `ensureSystemResolverUsesBind()` already keeps pointed at
BIND. The container could not resolve the custom 3GPP PLMN FQDNs at all
(confirmed via `getent hosts` returning empty from inside the container),
so the check reported "HTTP 000" unconditionally regardless of whether the
NF was actually healthy. An initial attempt to fix this assumed a
post-restart timing race and added a 4-attempt retry with backoff — deployed
and re-tested live, it still failed 100% of the time, disproving that theory.
Root cause confirmed by comparing a direct in-container curl (still `000`)
against the same request run via `nsenter` into the host (`400` — a real
response) for the identical FQDN. Fixed by switching the check to
`executeCommand` (nsenter into the host, the same pattern this file already
uses for `dig` in Phase A), trimming the now-unnecessary retry back down to
a light 2-attempt margin for genuine NF-startup timing. Verified live by
running the exact nsenter command the fixed code executes.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.22] - 2026-07-22

### Changed — VoLTE/VoWiFi E2E test calls now hold for 15s instead of ~1s

Both test modules moved straight from "bandwidth confirmed" to "hang up,"
so a packet capture taken during a test run only ever caught about a
second of real media — not enough to meaningfully inspect RTP sequence
continuity, jitter, or sustained codec behavior over time. Added a "Hold
call" step (15s, configurable via a `CALL_HOLD_MS` constant) between RTP
verification and hangup in both `volte-validation-controller.ts` and
`vowifi-validation-controller.ts`.

Used this to independently verify VoWiFi end-to-end at the packet level
(captured on both `lo` and the tunnel's `veth-swu` interface during a real
test run): confirmed real IKEv2 negotiation and 388 bidirectional
ESP-encrypted packets between the emulated UE and osmo-epdg, plus 181
packets of genuinely decrypted uplink RTP (opus-coded, ~20ms spacing)
crossing out of the tunnel toward the P-CSCF media relay — proof the
tunnel carries real voice, not just a live IKE handshake with nothing
behind it. Also confirmed the IKEv2/ESP traffic never appears on `lo` at
all — it's entirely contained within the netns↔veth boundary, which is why
capturing on the tunnel's veth interface specifically was necessary.

### Fixed — Packet Capture: start() falsely reported a dead capture as running

`systemd-run` (no `--wait`, by design — captures are long-running
background processes) only confirms the transient unit was accepted, not
that `dumpcap` actually started capturing. Found live while capturing a
VoWiFi test's dynamically-created veth interface: `dumpcap` exited within
milliseconds ("no such device") even though a plain `ip link show` moments
earlier confirmed the interface existed, while `systemd-run` itself still
reported success — `start()` was unconditionally returning
`status:'running'` for a capture that had already silently died, only ever
caught later by `listCaptures()`'s reconciliation, by which point the
caller had already moved on believing it was live. Now verifies with
`isServiceActive()` after a brief settle, retries once (the same interface
succeeded on an immediate retry when reproduced live, consistent with a
transient race against a freshly-created interface), and surfaces the real
`journalctl` error immediately if it still fails, instead of a false
"running" status.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.21] - 2026-07-21

### Added — SAS: manual-group exact-slot allow-list enforcement

An operator can now create a manual interference-coordination group on the
SAS Band Assignment page, assign radios to it, and configure exact
`customSlots` on its band policy — from then on, narrow spectrumInquiry/
grant requests from member radios are constrained to exactly those slots.
Enforced at both spectrumInquiry time (non-allowed frequencies are never
even advertised as available) and grant time (rejected with INTERFERENCE,
not UNSUPPORTED_SPECTRUM — the latter would deregister the CBSD entirely).
Deliberately vendor-agnostic: the only trigger is a CBSD's effective group
being a manually-created group (not a native radio-reported one) with
`customSlots` configured — confirmed a native group like Sercomm's
SC_Group/SERCOMM_5G is structurally excluded even if it also has
`customSlots`, since its own narrow CA requests are expected to land off
the exact slot boundary. Built and verified against a real Nokia AirScale
Pico radio, including a full natural reboot cycle with zero manual DB
intervention needed afterward.

### Fixed — real bugs found via live SAS testing on the dev host

- `assignChannelSlot()`'s Baicells sticky-slot fallback loop stopped
  advancing once it reached the last slot index, even if that slot was
  itself already held, silently returning an occupied slot instead of
  recognizing "no free slot" — a 3rd radio arriving when only 2 of N slots
  were actually free (traced to the group's band policy having briefly
  pointed at the wrong band) collided with whichever radio held the last
  slot, producing two CBSDs authorized on the identical frequency range.
  Fixed to count real per-slot occupancy and pick a genuinely free slot, or
  explicitly share the least-occupied one with a logged warning.
- `spectrumInquiry()`'s out-of-band redirect math — written for Sercomm's
  fixed 2-entry CA pattern — silently produced zero-width or inverted
  (low>high) "available channels" for a Nokia AirScale Pico radio, whose SAS
  client tiles a full-band scan into 15 separate 10MHz entries instead. The
  radio could never parse a valid channel from that response and never
  proceeded to a grant request. Fixed by skipping out-of-band entries
  entirely for Nokia specifically; every other vendor's behavior is
  unchanged.
- `sas_manual_groups` stored raw, ephemeral `cbsdId`s — a radio's `cbsdId`
  regenerates on every re-registration (the same root cause already fixed
  for `sas_baicells_slots`/`sas_cbsd_policies` via `fccId:serial` keys), so a
  manual group silently lost track of its members on every radio reboot.
  Now stores `fccId:serial` internally, translated at the API boundary so
  the REST contract and frontend are unaffected.
- `getSlotLayout()` (feeds the SAS dashboard chart) always built its
  displayed slot grid from a band's own default width, completely ignoring
  any group's `customSlots` — so the chart never reflected an exact-slot
  restriction, showing the wrong EARFCNs. Now shows the actual configured
  `customSlots` for any band with a group that has them.
- The Band Assignment page's manual-group name field re-sorted the whole
  list and remounted its own input on every keystroke (the live-edited value
  doubled as both the sort key and React's list key), dropping focus
  mid-word — fixed with a stable, never-edited key used purely for
  ordering/identity. The "Unsaved — click Save to apply these slots" banner
  also stayed lit permanently regardless of actual save state (it checked
  the wrong condition); now does a real dirty comparison against what's
  actually persisted.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.20] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed — Enforce Open5GS's 8-framed-route-per-family limit on subscriber sessions

Open5GS caps framed routes at 8 per address family per session
(`OGS_MAX_NUM_OF_FRAMED_ROUTES_IN_PDN`) — a 9th entry isn't rejected by the
core NFs, it's silently dropped, so a subscriber could previously be saved
with more routes than would actually ever take effect. `validation-schemas.ts`
now caps both `ipv4_framed_routes` and `ipv6_framed_routes` at 8 (covers
subscriber creation); `subscriber-management.ts`'s `update()` never ran the
full schema (its `dto` is a `Partial<SubscriberDto>` missing required
top-level fields, which would fail a full parse), so a dedicated
`validateFramedRouteLimits()` check was added there too, otherwise the cap
would only ever apply on create, not on edit. `SubscriberPage.tsx` now shows
a live "N/8 routes" counter per input that turns red past the limit, and
disables Save/Update with an inline warning instead of letting the operator
find out only after a rejected submit.

## [v2.0-beta_0.19] - 2026-07-19

### Added — PLMN Migration Wizard

New Auto Config tab (`PlmnMigrationTab.tsx`) for a coordinated mass MCC/MNC
change across every layer that references the PLMN in one operation: core
NF `plmn_id` values, DNS (reusing the DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard's Phase A/B/C
logic), IMS, SMS, and VoWiFi, with a dry-run plan preview, per-phase (A–E)
apply buttons with scrollable logs, backup, and rollback. SAS/CBRS, radio
TR-069 provisioning, and subscriber records are deliberately out of scope.
`configureIms`/`configureSms`/`configureVowifi` were extracted from their
respective `/configure` HTTP routes into standalone functions so the wizard
can call each module's real configure logic in-process with an explicit
`{ ...currentConfig, mcc, mnc }` input, instead of an empty-body HTTP
self-call that would silently reset every other already-configured
parameter back to hardcoded defaults.

Verified with a full live round-trip (999/070 → 001/01 → 999/070) on the dev
host, including a 17-NF health check, the Phase E cross-service PLMN
consistency check, and both the VoLTE and VoWiFi E2E test modules passing
under the new PLMN. Four real bugs were found and fixed in the process, all
the same underlying issue in different code paths: **`yaml.load()`'s YAML 1.1
octal parsing silently corrupts leading-zero mcc/mnc/sd values** (e.g. `"070"`
becomes the number `70`) whenever a save path re-parses a raw YAML file
outside `YamlConfigRepository.loadRaw()`'s own string-preserving pass —
found in `saveRaw()`'s merge-base read, `vowifi-controller.ts`'s
`upsertSmfAaaPeer()`, and SMS's `extractExistingMapEntries()` (which also
left behind several corrupted duplicate `sgsap` map entries in `mme.yaml`
from repeated Configure runs before the fix). The fourth bug: Phase D's
`configureSms()`/`configureVowifi()` wrote fresh config but never restarted
their own daemons (osmo-stp/hlr/msc; vowifi-osmo-epdg/charon), so a running
`osmo-epdg` kept presenting the *old* PLMN's S6b identity until an unrelated
restart happened to pick up the change.

### Added — Subscriber IMSI editing

The Edit Subscriber form's IMSI field was unconditionally disabled outside
create mode, even though the backend's `update()` already had working (if
unreachable) conflict-detection for a renamed IMSI. Enabled the field in
edit mode; `subscriber-management.ts` now validates the new IMSI's format
when changed, cascades the rename into `nms_subscriber_groups.imsis` (group
membership is stored by raw IMSI value, not a foreign key), and returns a
warning reminding the operator to re-sync IMS/SMS afterward — both PyHSS
and OsmoHLR keep their own IMSI-keyed copy and treat a renamed IMSI as
"old deleted, new created" until their own sync-subscribers endpoint runs.

### Added — Packet Capture module

New top-level "Packet Capture" page (`ENABLE_PCAP_MODULE`, default on) for
capturing real on-the-wire traffic on any host interface, scoped by NF, 4G/5G
function type, all-GTP, or custom BPF at capture time, and decoded afterward
with Wireshark display-filter presets (5G Core, IMS/VoLTE/VoWiFi, 4G EPC,
GTP only) — including the exact filter strings requested (`gtpv2 || gtp ||
ngap || s1ap || pfcp || diameter || http2` for 5G Core, `sip || diameter ||
pfcp || gtp` for IMS). NF/port descriptors are built from live config, never
hardcoded, since `auto-config.ts` can rebind MME/AMF/UPF/SGW-U off loopback
onto real routable addresses. Captures run as transient host systemd units
(`nsenter` + `systemd-run --collect` + `dumpcap`), not bare spawned child
processes, specifically so an in-progress capture survives a backend
container restart/redeploy — proven live by restarting the backend
mid-capture and confirming it kept running and was correctly reconciled as
still-active afterward.

Clicking a packet row opens a collapsible, Wireshark-style Packet Details
tree (parsed from `tshark -T pdml`, the same format Wireshark's own "Export
Packet Dissection" uses) plus a hex/ASCII bytes pane, rather than a flat
text dump — expand any protocol layer (Frame, Ethernet II, IP, ...) down to
individual bit-level sub-fields, collapsed by default exactly like a fresh
packet selection in the real Wireshark GUI.

Interface groups (Loopback/TUN/Physical/Other) carry hover tooltips
explaining what traffic actually lands on each — `dummy-*`/`veth`
interfaces were dropped from the picker entirely after live-testing showed
real unicast traffic to a dummy-interface IP (e.g. the AMF's `dummy-amf`
address) is delivered via loopback, not the dummy device itself, which only
ever saw unrelated broadcast traffic (EIGRP hellos).

Eight real bugs were found and fixed via live testing on the dev host:
mme/hss/pcrf/sgwc/sgwu/sepp1 silently missing from the NF picker (`loadGeneric()`
has no `s1ap`/`freeDiameter` parser and sepp1's real YAML key is `sepp`, not
`sepp1`); `dumpcap` silently ignoring a single trailing `-f` filter with
multiple `-i` interfaces (must be repeated per-interface); tshark's cosmetic
"Running as root" stderr line drowning out real error messages in the UI;
`getSummary()` missing the SBI HTTP/2 decode-as hint, making genuinely
captured SBI traffic look absent from the protocol hierarchy view; Node's
default 1MB `execFile` buffer silently killing large `tshark -T fields`
decodes with no real error (now a 100MB ceiling, a latent bug affecting
every `LocalHostExecutor` caller, not just this module); an invalid BPF
filter for any NF selection touching the Diameter mesh's `127.0.0.0/8`
placeholder (`host` only accepts a single IP, needed `net` for a CIDR
range); and `fast-xml-parser` not decoding numeric HTML entities like
`&#x27;` in PDML attribute values by default.

## [v2.0-beta_0.18] - 2026-07-18

### Added — VoWiFi end-to-end test module + VoLTE test verbosity

New "Run VoWiFi Test" card on the UE Validation page, mirroring the VoLTE E2E
test but genuinely tunneled: reuses the SWu-IKEv2 emulator to establish a real
IKEv2/EAP-AKA IPsec tunnel to the configured ePDG, then runs `linphonec`
*inside that tunnel's network namespace* so SIP/RTP actually transit the
encrypted tunnel — the same path a real VoWiFi phone takes. Registers,
places a call to a plain local test subscriber, verifies bidirectional RTP,
tears down the tunnel and both test identities automatically regardless of
outcome. `swu-emulator-controller.ts`'s tunnel start/stop logic was refactored
into reusable exported functions so both the manual "Test Tunnel" UI and this
new test module share one implementation.

Also made the existing VoLTE test module's output significantly more verbose:
every step now carries a human-readable detail (what was actually created/
registered/sent), and SIP-signaling steps carry an expandable raw log
transcript in the UI, not just a pass/fail pill.

### Fixed — real bugs surfaced while live-verifying the new VoWiFi test

- `osmo-epdg`'s S6b Diameter identity was never wired up during VoWiFi
  Configure — it shipped with the stock `aaa.localdomain`/`localdomain`
  placeholders while SMF's own S6b peer config correctly expected
  `aaa.<real-plmn-realm>`. This silently broke *all* VoWiFi tunnel
  establishment (not just the new test module): Open5GS SMF misinterprets
  the resulting S6b failure and sends a phantom Gx CCR-Termination for a
  session that was never created, which PCRF correctly rejects
  (`DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_SESSION_ID`) — surfacing to the IKE client as a generic
  `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` with no indication the real cause was a Diameter
  identity mismatch two hops away. Fixed `vowifi-controller.ts`'s Configure
  to patch osmo-epdg's `dia_s6b_origin_host`/`dia_s6b_origin_realm`/
  `dia_s6b_context_id` from the real PLMN, matching what SMF already expects.
- VoWiFi's `/start` route had the same `systemctl enable --now` no-op bug
  found earlier in BIND9/IMS's Configure flows — a no-op on an
  already-running unit, so Configure changes (like the S6b fix above)
  wouldn't take effect until something else happened to restart the
  service. Now uses `enable` + unconditional `restart`.
- The host's `/etc/resolv.conf` reverted to `8.8.8.8`/`8.8.4.4` for a third
  time this session (same class of issue as the earlier NF crash-loop
  incident), this time breaking Kamailio's own SIP domain resolution mid-test.
  The exact trigger wasn't conclusively identified (ruled out resolvconf,
  DHCP hooks, NetworkManager, and dummy-interface creation, which
  deliberately avoids triggering a networkd reload) — made the file
  immutable (`chattr +i`) as a durable safeguard pending further investigation.

## [v2.0-beta_0.17] - 2026-07-18

### Added — Automated VoLTE end-to-end test module (UE Validation)

New "Run VoLTE Test" card on the UE Validation page
(`POST /api/validation/volte/run`, streamed NDJSON progress). Provisions two
disposable PyHSS-only test subscribers, drives two `linphonec` instances through
REGISTER (both) → place call → answer → verify bidirectional RTP → hang up, and
always cleans up (deprovision subscribers, revert S-CSCF back to `HSS-Selected`
auth) regardless of outcome. Deliberately isolated to the IMS/SIP signaling layer —
no RAN/NAS/UERANSIM/srsRAN involvement, unlike the rest of this module's sessions.

### Fixed — real bugs surfaced while live-verifying the new test module

- `ims-controller.ts`'s `/configure` route used `systemctl enable --now` to bring
  up the 4 kamailio-* CSCF services, which is a no-op on an already-running unit —
  since none of them hot-reload config (cdp's Diameter Peer/DefaultRoute config is
  parsed once at startup), a *re*-Configure on a long-running host silently left a
  stale process running against newly-regenerated config files. Now uses `enable` +
  unconditional `restart` for those 4 services, matching what `/api/ims/restart`
  already did correctly.
- New test module's step-streaming helper only invoked its callback on success —
  a failing step's name/detail never reached the client, only a generic error on
  the final line. Fixed so both outcomes stream immediately.
- New test module wrote its scratch config files via the container's own `/tmp`
  instead of the host's (`/proc/1/root` prefix was missing) — `linphonec`, which
  runs inside the host's mount namespace via `nsenter -m`, couldn't find them.
- New test module hardcoded P-CSCF's address as `127.0.0.1` instead of reading the
  actual configured `pcscfIp`/`pcscfPort` from `.ims-config.json`.
- Added `restart: unless-stopped` to MongoDB's compose service
  (`mongo_docker/docker-compose-basic.yaml`) — found stopped with no auto-restart
  during this session's earlier DNS-outage triage.


## [v2.0-beta_0.16] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed — VoLTE SIP REGISTER now actually completes (real end-to-end test, `linphonec`)

Following the v2.0-beta_0.15 install/configure fixes, drove a real SIP REGISTER
through the full P-CSCF → I-CSCF → S-CSCF → PyHSS chain using `linphonec` (a
console SIP client) against a Digest-MD5 test subscriber. Found and fixed 7 more
real bugs uncovered only by an actual end-to-end auth handshake — none of these
were reachable by the install/configure smoke-testing alone:

- IMS DNS zone had no apex A record. Added one pointing at **I-CSCF**, not
  P-CSCF: P-CSCF's own `route[REGISTER]` has no explicit dispatcher target (that
  only exists under `WITH_SBC`, unused here) — its `t_relay()` falls back to
  Kamailio's own RFC 3263 resolution of the Request-URI domain, which must land
  on I-CSCF (does the Cx UAR/LIR S-CSCF lookup) or P-CSCF ends up relaying to
  itself. Also added apex SRV/NAPTR records for UEs that resolve the bare
  home-network domain directly.
- `icscfDiameterXml()`/`scscfDiameterXml()` had a `<Peer>` element but no
  `<DefaultRoute>` — confirmed against cdp's own `configparser.c`: `<Peer>` only
  drives CER/CEA connectivity, `<DefaultRoute>` is the *only* thing that
  populates cdp's outbound routing table. Without it, Diameter connections came
  up (TCP ESTABLISHED) but every UAR/MAR/SAR failed with "Empty routing table".
- `ifc_path` was never set when creating `ims_subscriber` rows. PyHSS's
  documented "falls back to the globally configured Default_iFC" behavior
  doesn't actually exist in its SAR handler — a NULL `ifc_path` crashes with
  `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split'`, silently timing
  out every registration's Server-Assignment-Request.
- PyHSS's `config.yaml` needs a `geored:` section unconditionally — one code
  path (`Update_Serving_CSCF`, called on every successful SAR) skips the safe
  `.get()` pattern used everywhere else in the codebase and does a bare
  `config['geored']['sync_actions']`, throwing `KeyError: 'geored'` without it.
- Missing `CxDataType_Rel7.xsd` (`modparam("ims_registrar_scscf", "user_data_xsd", ...)`)
  — every SAA's iFC XML failed schema validation, surfacing as a confusing
  `"500 Server error on UAR select next S-CSCF"` once no more candidate S-CSCFs
  were left to retry. Bundled the authoritative copy straight from Kamailio's
  own `ims_registrar_scscf` module source.
- The bundled iFC Jinja2 templates used bare `{{ imsi }}`/`{{ msisdn }}` —
  PyHSS actually renders with `template.render(iFC_vars=ims_subscriber_details)`,
  nesting every field under a single `iFC_vars` dict. Bare variables silently
  render as empty strings (no error), producing `<PrivateID>@</PrivateID>` and
  failing schema validation. Fixed to `{{ iFC_vars.imsi }}` etc.
- Template used `<IMSAddressOfRecord>` inside `PublicIdentity`; the real 3GPP
  Rel7 XSD (`tPublicIdentity`) requires the child element to be named
  `<Identity>` — `IMSAddressOfRecord` doesn't exist in this schema at all.

Also fixed `Default_iFC`/`Default_Sh_UserData`/per-subscriber `ifc_path` to use
paths relative to PyHSS's own Jinja2 `FileSystemLoader` (`searchpath="../"`,
resolved from its `/opt/pyhss` cwd) instead of filesystem-absolute paths, which
404 as Jinja2 template names.

With all of the above, a full REGISTER → 401 challenge → credentialed REGISTER →
200 OK round trip now completes cleanly, confirmed registered in S-CSCF's usrloc
with a proper `Service-Route` and `P-Associated-URI`.

## [v2.0-beta_0.15] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed — DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard: systemd-resolved bypass no longer requires a manual fix

Live end-to-end wizard run on a freshly-redeployed host (test01) surfaced that Phase A
can make BIND answer every record correctly while `getaddrinfo()` (what every NF
actually calls) still bypasses it entirely, because `/etc/resolv.conf` points at
systemd-resolved's stub — this used to require a separate, easy-to-forget manual call
to `POST /api/bind/fix-resolver` before Phase C. `dns-migration-usecase.ts` now checks
and fixes this automatically at the end of Phase A and again as a pre-flight guard at
the start of Phase C, reusing the same detection logic as the BIND page's own health
check.

### Fixed — DNS Migration Phase C's own verification was always wrong

Phase C's post-restart check (`curl` to each NF's SBI port) reported `HTTP 000` for
every NF regardless of health, because Open5GS's SBI servers are HTTP/2-cleartext
(h2c) only and expect prior-knowledge, not a plain HTTP/1.1 request — confirmed live
against a genuinely healthy NRF (000 without `--http2-prior-knowledge`, a real 400
with it). Also added a `systemctl is-active` check for all 11 SBI NFs after restart —
Phase C now actually fails if any NF crashed, instead of reporting `success:true`
regardless (the exact historical failure class already called out in this project's
conventions).

### Fixed — IMS install/configure: several real gaps that made a fresh install non-functional

A live install/configure run on a freshly-redeployed host surfaced that IMS had
effectively never worked on any host other than the original dev machine, which had
accumulated undocumented, hand-applied fixes from earlier sessions that were never
written back into the actual application code:

- The `cdp.so` process-slot patch (works around a real Kamailio bug where the CDP
  timer hits "Process limit exceeded", breaking Cx/Rx Diameter) silently failed on
  Ubuntu 24.04 — its deb-src detection false-positived on a comment inside cloud-init's
  `ubuntu.sources.curtin.orig` backup file, and it never understood the new deb822
  `ubuntu.sources` format Ubuntu 24.04 defaults to. The step's exit code also was never
  checked, so a failed patch was reported as install success. Fixed the deb-src setup
  and now warns loudly on failure.
- The ~1200-line main Kamailio routing-script configs for P/I/S-CSCF, and all 6
  systemd units (P/I/S-CSCF + PyHSS hss/api/diameter), were never written by any code
  path — they only existed because an earlier session placed them by hand on one dev
  host. Bundled as static templates (`backend/src/config/ims-templates/`, following the
  existing `config/defaults` convention) and wired into `/configure`.
- Three Kamailio modules the templates require (`presence`, `sctp`, `json`) were never
  in `/install`'s package list.
- The bundled configs need Kamailio 5.8.x — Ubuntu 24.04's own archive only has 5.7.4,
  which cannot resolve a `#!substdef` used across an `import_file` boundary that these
  configs rely on. `/install` now adds the official `deb.kamailio.org` repo before
  installing (this repo previously only existed as a hand-added file on one dev host,
  from 2026-06-20, predating this session — never in the codebase or its git history).
- `/sync-subscribers` restarts `pyhss-hss`, which now correctly cascades to restart
  `pyhss-api` too (now that `pyhss-api`'s systemd unit correctly `Requires=pyhss-hss`,
  fixing the second bullet above) — but PyHSS's own startup reliably takes ~25-30s
  (Diameter library init), while the code only waited a fixed 3 seconds, so every
  subscriber sync call hit an API that wasn't listening yet. Replaced with a real
  readiness poll (up to 45s).

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.14] - 2026-07-17

### Added — SMS over SGs uninstall

- New `POST /api/sms/uninstall` + Uninstall button on the SMS page: stops+disables
  osmo-stp/osmo-hlr/osmo-msc, removes the sgsap block from mme.yaml (restarting
  open5gs-mmed), deletes the Osmocom config files and the OsmoHLR database, and purges
  the osmo-stp/osmo-hlr/osmo-msc packages (deliberately not `sqlite3` — a generic system
  utility, not SMS-specific). Same confirmation-modal + streaming-log UX as VoWiFi's
  existing uninstall.

### Fixed — VoWiFi uninstall left the `gtp` kernel module loaded

Every previous VoWiFi uninstall left the `gtp` kernel module (and `gtp0`) active on the
host even though osmo-epdg — the only thing that ever uses it in this deployment — was
already stopped. Uninstall now runs `rmmod gtp` right after stopping services.

### Added — BIND9 self-healing (real incident found and fixed live, 2026-07-17)

While debugging a live "whole 5G core crash-looping" incident (root cause: DNS/FQDN
migration's NFs FATAL on startup if their advertise FQDN can't resolve — see
`docs/troubleshooting.md`), found and fixed the actual underlying causes, then added
permanent detection + one-click repair so this doesn't require SSH-ing in by hand again:

- **Root cause #1**: `apt purge bind9` wipes `named.conf.local`/`named.conf.options`
  back to their stock Debian package defaults on reinstall — but the zone *files* under
  `zones/` survive (the package doesn't own that directory), silently orphaning them.
- **Root cause #2**: even with BIND itself healthy, `/etc/resolv.conf` can be a
  `systemd-resolved` stub symlink (127.0.0.53) instead of pointing at BIND (127.0.0.1) —
  every NF's own `getaddrinfo()` call bypasses BIND entirely in that case, regardless of
  BIND's own health.
- **Fix**: `bind-controller.ts` now exposes `GET /api/bind/status` with three new health
  fields (`undeclaredZones`, `optionsNeedsRepair`, `resolvConfBypassesBind`), plus two
  new actions: `POST /api/bind/repair` (re-declares any orphaned zone file and
  re-asserts recursion/allow-query/forwarders/listen-on — safe to call anytime, a no-op
  if nothing's wrong) and `POST /api/bind/fix-resolver` (disables
  `systemd-resolved`'s stub listener, repoints `/etc/resolv.conf` at BIND — kept as a
  separate, explicit action from `/repair` since it changes host-wide DNS behavior, not
  just BIND's own config). The BIND page shows clear warning banners with one-click fix
  buttons only when actually needed — verified zero false positives against a real,
  healthy multi-zone BIND install, and verified both issues for real on two separate
  hosts before this fix (one via live SSH debugging, one caught proactively on the dev
  host by the same new detection logic).

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.13] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed — nginx fails to start on a fresh install

- **Real bug, found on a genuinely clean-host install**: nginx crash-looped forever
  (`cannot load certificate "/etc/nginx/certs/acs.crt"`), making the entire web UI
  unreachable. Root cause: `nginx.conf`'s port-443 vhost (the Sercomm factory-default
  ACS DNS-hijack relay, `server_name acs.sc.sercomm.com`) requires `acs.crt`/`acs.key`,
  but no script anywhere ever generated them — only `sas.crt`/`sas.key` had an
  auto-generation step (`nginx/setup-sas-cert.sh`, run by the `cert-init` Docker
  service). On existing dev hosts `acs.crt` had been created manually at some point in
  the past and just sat there, masking the gap; a fresh host never gets it.
- `nginx/setup-sas-cert.sh` now generates **both** certs — refactored into a
  `generate_cert()` helper called once for `sas` (CN=`sas.local`, any hostname) and
  once for `acs` (CN=`acs.sc.sercomm.com`, matching nginx.conf's hardcoded
  `server_name` and every factory-reset Sercomm radio's hardcoded ACS URL). Same
  skip-if-exists behavior as before, same manual-run instructions, no docker-compose.yml
  changes needed — `cert-init` already mounts and runs this exact file.

### Added — SEPP wired into Services/Logs pages

- Follow-up from SEPP shipping in v2.0-beta_0.10: SEPP is now a valid target for the
  Services page's individual Start/Stop/Restart/Enable/Disable controls and the "Start/
  Stop 5G Group" bulk action (`sepp1` added to `service-controller.ts`'s validation
  gates and `ServicesPage.tsx`'s `SERVICES_5G` group), and to the Logs page's log
  source menu (`open5gs-seppd` already logs to `/var/log/open5gs/sepp1.log` by
  convention, so this needed no backend changes). Confirmed live: SEPP was already
  showing on the Dashboard automatically (it has no hardcoded per-NF list, just
  reflects whatever the service-status feed returns) — the actual gap was only the
  Services page's per-action allowlist. Deliberately not wired into the Auto-Config
  Wizard, per explicit decision — that wizard's scope stays as-is.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.12] - 2026-07-16

### Added — Framed Routing

- Subscriber sessions now support 3GPP Framed Routing (TS 23.501 §5.6.14) — lets a UE act
  as a gateway for an IP subnet behind it (e.g. an IoT gateway or fixed-wireless CPE with
  a LAN), routed through that UE's single PDU session. New `ipv4_framed_routes`/
  `ipv6_framed_routes` array fields per session, editable directly on the Subscriber page
  (comma-separated CIDR list), plus CSV import/export support (`framed_routes` column,
  pipe-separated, mirrors the existing MSISDN convention)
- **Static host route automation** — an "Apply static route on host" checkbox per
  session auto-manages the local `ip route` needed for the subnet to actually be
  reachable, resolving the correct `ogstun*` device from the session's DNN (not
  hardcoded) via live `upf.yaml`. Idempotent add/remove, diffed on every subscriber
  create/update/delete so routes never orphan
- **Overlap/duplicate warnings (non-blocking)** — on save, new framed routes are checked
  for exact-duplicate or CIDR-overlap conflicts against every other subscriber's framed
  routes and against the core UE pool subnets (from `upf.yaml`/`smf.yaml`), surfaced as
  toast warnings without blocking the save (an operator may be intentionally staging a
  route). IPv4 uses full numeric-range overlap math; IPv6 is exact-string-duplicate only
  (no 128-bit prefix library in this codebase yet — documented as a known limitation)
- **Framed Routes Registry** — new modal (Subscribers page → Addressing dropdown) listing
  every configured subnet across all subscribers, with owning IMSI/nickname, APN, and
  whether a static route is currently applied
- In-app guidance: the static-route checkbox's hint explains that a local route alone
  isn't enough — the rest of the network needs its own route to that subnet too, either
  via dynamic routing (e.g. an EIGRP `network` statement, not automated — FRR eigrpd has
  a documented crash-loop history, so this app deliberately never edits `frr.conf` for
  this) or a manual static route on the core/edge router pointing at **this Open5GS
  host's own IP**, never the UE's IP (the UE isn't a direct L3 hop from outside this
  host — this host is what forwards into the UE's tunnel), with a worked example
- Found and fixed a real bug while building the overlap math: the shared CIDR
  range/overlap helper (`backend/src/domain/services/ip-utils.ts`, extracted from
  previously-duplicated logic in `validation-controller.ts` and
  `swu-emulator-controller.ts`) produced a corrupted signed integer for any subnet whose
  first octet is ≥128 (e.g. `192.168.x.x`) — silently returning wrong host-pool ranges
  for IP auto-assignment too, not just the new overlap check. Fixed for both use sites

### Changed

- IMS and VoWiFi alpha warning banners now open with the same framing sentence: *"The
  goal is a 100% automated deployment — today, expect to do manual configuration beyond
  what this wizard automates."* Each banner keeps its own module-specific detail below.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.11] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — DNS/FQDN Migration Wizard: SEPP gap

- The DNS/FQDN migration wizard (converts hardcoded IPs to 3GPP FQDN/DNS addressing for
  every NF) didn't account for SEPP at all. Fixed two real bugs found while adding it:
  - SEPP's local SBI client (to our own SCP/NRF) was missing from the migration's service
    list entirely — added to both the DNS-zone and SBI-client phases. SEPP's N32 peer
    interface (to the *visited* PLMN's own SEPP) is correctly still excluded — that
    belongs to a different operator's infrastructure, not something local DNS resolves
  - `sepp1.yaml`'s internal YAML key is `sepp`, not `sepp1` — unlike every other NF where
    the filename matches the top-level key. The migration code was patching under the
    wrong key before this was caught and fixed with a `yamlKeyFor()` mapping helper
- **Production incident found and fixed during live testing**: `open5gs-seppd` does
  strict, synchronous DNS resolution of its own `advertise` FQDN at startup and aborts
  fatally (core-dump) if the record doesn't exist yet — unlike every other NF, which
  tolerates an unresolvable advertise value fine. Running the SBI-mesh migration phase
  for SEPP without the DNS-zone phase already reflecting its current FQDN crash-loops the
  service until the DNS phase is (re)run. Documented as a permanent operational note:
  always run the DNS-zone phase immediately before the SBI-mesh phase for SEPP, not just
  once at the start of a migration

### Fixed — Stale subscriber sync (OsmoHLR / SMS)

- SMS's `sync-subscribers` action (provisions MSISDN into OsmoHLR for CS-fallback SMS)
  only ever inserted/updated currently-eligible subscribers, with no reconciliation pass
  — a subscriber later deleted from Open5GS, or with its MSISDN cleared, stayed behind in
  OsmoHLR forever. Added a reconciliation step (mirroring the same fix already applied to
  IMS's subscriber sync) that removes OsmoHLR rows whose IMSI is no longer eligible.
  Surfaced in the UI as a "removed N stale" count alongside the existing sync result

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.10] - 2026-07-16

### Added — SEPP (Security Edge Protection Proxy)

- SEPP is now a fully configurable 17th core NF, on equal footing with the other 16 —
  its own Config tab, included in the standard bulk "Apply Config" restart flow, backed
  up with the rest. Previously the Config page had a static disclaimer that SEPP wasn't
  managed by this UI at all; that's no longer true
- **Home SEPP configuration** — SBI server/client (SCP), N32 identity (sender FQDN,
  scheme, N32-c/N32-f address+port), and an optional TLS section
- **TLS support with in-app cert generation** — a toggle switches N32 between plaintext
  HTTP and mutual TLS; when enabled, a "Generate Certs" action creates a self-signed
  keypair for the home SEPP's identity via `openssl req -x509` (the standard simplified
  trust model for a lab/test roaming setup, not a real GSMA-IPX-backed PKI), with the
  public cert displayed for copying and a paste box for the visited peer's public cert
- **"Generate Visited PLMN Config"** — a separate panel builds a complete, downloadable
  `sepp.yaml` for the visited-network operator's side, cross-referencing our
  already-configured home SEPP values and including our public cert content when TLS is
  enabled — so a real roaming partner has everything needed in one download
- Kept the existing `/etc/open5gs/sepp1.yaml`/`sepp2.yaml` filenames (matching the
  pre-existing systemd unit and the open5gs tutorial's naming) rather than migrating to a
  new name, since `open5gs-seppd` was already installed and running with TLS enabled
  using the tutorial's demo config when this feature was built
- New audit action `sepp_generate_certs`; all SEPP endpoints are admin-only

## [v2.0-beta_0.9] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — FRR eigrpd crash-guard patch

- Hand-built patch on top of the from-source FRR 10.6.1 build, closing a long-standing
  upstream-unfixed bug ([FRRouting/frr#943](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/943))
  that crashed the entire `eigrpd` process — and withdrew every EIGRP-learned route,
  dropping every connected radio's S1AP/N2 association — whenever it fired. Confirmed
  recurring 3x in 3 days on this deployment (2026-07-12, then twice within 21 minutes on
  2026-07-15), triggered by events entirely outside this host's control (a dummy
  interface change, and separately a new EIGRP neighbor adjacency forming elsewhere on
  the network)
- Fix: replaces the six `assert(successors)` calls in `eigrpd/eigrp_fsm.c` that abort
  the process on a real, reachable (not corrupted) topology-table state with a graceful
  log-and-skip guard — DUAL re-evaluates the affected prefix on the next cycle instead
  of the whole daemon dying. Does not fix the true root cause (a maintainer-acknowledged
  FIFO/FILO ordering issue in EIGRP's DUAL FSM, never fully resolved upstream since
  2017) — only stops it from taking down routing entirely
- Verified stable for 12+ hours post-deploy with zero crashes, versus 3 crashes in the
  prior 3 days
- Full writeup, code, and reapplication steps: **[docs/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard-patch.md](docs/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard-patch.md)**, patch file at `docs/patches/frr-eigrpd-crash-guard.patch`

## [v2.0-beta_0.8] - 2026-07-16

### Added — eSIM Generator (Simlessly API)

- New "Generate eSIM" action on the Subscribers page — per-row (pre-fills from that
  subscriber's IMSI/K/OPc/MSISDN/ICCID) and a page-level toolbar button (blank entry,
  with an inline subscriber picker)
- Builds and sends a real, signed request to the [Simlessly](https://docs.simlessly.com)
  RSP platform's Single Generate AC API (`POST /api/v2/ac/generate`), returning a real
  activation code and, optionally, an AC link rendered as a scannable QR image
- Core fields (ICCID, IMSI, KI, Config Name) always visible; the rest of Simlessly's
  optional field set (OPC, MSISDN, PLMN lists, IMS params, PIN/PUK/ADM1, SMSP) lives
  behind a collapsed "Advanced" section
- The exact request JSON is always shown too, with copy-to-clipboard, independent of
  whether the live API is called — useful for manual use in other tools
- Requires `SIMLESSLY_ACCESS_KEY`/`SIMLESSLY_SECRET_KEY` (new env vars, obtained from
  the Developer module on your own Simlessly account) — the JSON preview works without
  them, but calling the live API does not. Admin-only action, audit logged
  (`esim_generate`) on every attempt, since it creates a real, likely billable resource
- Not yet supported: batch generation, live lookup of Simlessly profile config names,
  and full profile lifecycle management (query/delete/expire, webhook notifications)

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.7] - 2026-07-11

### Added — New Modules

**IMS / VoLTE — alpha, not production-ready**
- ⚠️ Early alpha: server-side IMS signaling has been verified with a third-party SIP client, but end-to-end VoLTE on real phones is not confirmed working and will likely require manual configuration beyond what the UI automates
- Full IMS core integration: P-CSCF/I-CSCF/S-CSCF (Kamailio 5.8.8), PyHSS Diameter HSS, BIND9 DNS, RTPEngine, MariaDB
- One-click install of Kamailio (built from source with IMS/TLS/MySQL/extra modules), MariaDB, BIND9, RTPEngine, Redis, and PyHSS (cloned from GitHub, Python deps via pip)
- Configure form wires P-CSCF into SMF (PCO + per-session DNS), writes Cx/Rx Diameter peer XML, generates the IMS DNS zone
- Subscriber sync pushes IMPI/IMPU identities into PyHSS's `ims_hss_db`
- **Known limitation:** Android's telephony framework suppresses VoLTE/SIP REGISTER on test PLMNs (MCC 999) — server-side signaling is verified with Linphone; see docs for the Early-IMS test procedure

**SMS over SGs**
- Osmocom CS-fallback SMS stack: `osmo-stp` + `osmo-hlr` + `osmo-msc`, connected to the MME via the SGs interface (SCTP)
- One-click package install, service lifecycle (start/stop/restart/enable/disable), subscriber sync (provisions MSISDN into OsmoHLR), and a raw config-file editor for all three `.cfg` files
- Requires a combined EPS/IMSI attach from the UE — no IMS/VoLTE deployment needed for basic SMS

**UE Validation**
- Spin up simulated 4G (srsRAN, built from a local Dockerfile) or 5G (UERANSIM) test UEs against your live core to validate attach, PDU session establishment, and idle-mode paging end-to-end without a physical radio
- Live log tailing, raw log download, and session persistence (survives an NMS backend restart)
- **Known limitation:** 5G idle-mode paging is unconfirmed — UERANSIM's simulated gNB may not implement an inactivity timer the way srsRAN's eNB does; 5G connected-state reachability is fully verified

**Subscriber Groups**
- Organize subscribers into named, colored groups on the Subscriber page — purely organizational (MongoDB-only), doesn't touch HSS/MME provisioning

**Sercomm 5G NR (Auto-Config)**
- New "Sercomm 5G" tab alongside the existing Open5GS/Femto/Baicells tabs — full SCE5164-B48 gNB (CU/DU split) provisioning including TDD slot configuration and SAS parameters

### Added — FRR / L3 Routing

- **Reinstall (Source) tab** — migrates FRR from the Ubuntu apt package (8.4.4, has long-standing eigrpd assertion-crash bugs — [FRRouting/frr#943](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/943), [#3701](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/issues/3701)) to a from-source build (10.6.1+, built against libyang), with automatic backup, build, config-restore, and rollback. Fixed a real recurring production issue: `eigrpd` was crash-looping and briefly withdrawing/relearning routes on every restart, causing intermittent SCTP (S1AP/N2) drops across every connected radio
- **Log-level selector** — dropdown on the L3 Routing page for FRR's 8 syslog severities (emergencies…debugging); writes both `log syslog` and `log file` directives and reloads via `vtysh -b` (no neighbor flap)
- **FRR log file** — `frr.log` now exists (`log file` directive added to the generated config) and FRR is wired in as a 4th source on the Unified Logs page, alongside Open5GS/Docker/GenieACS
- **Nav reorganization** — TUN Interfaces and Dummy Interfaces are now sub-tabs of the L3 Routing page instead of separate top-level nav items, grouping all Layer 3 functionality together

### Added — Real-Time Logging

- **Syslog Forwarding** — forwards all Open5GS NF, GenieACS, and FRR logs to a remote syslog server (e.g. Graylog) via rsyslog. Detects/installs rsyslog if missing; writes a dedicated, fully self-owned drop-in file (never edits an existing `rsyslog.conf`); automatically fixes the two host-level gotchas that silently block this (AppArmor confinement, `frr` group read permission) via their own sanctioned override mechanisms
- **Major Events view** — new "Events" tab showing only classified, meaningful transitions (radio connect/disconnect, 4G attach/detach, 5G register/deregister, PDU session up/down) instead of raw DEBUG noise, across all 16 NF streams at once. Filterable by event type, radio, and IMSI (AND-across, OR-within). Click any event to open a zoomable log-context viewer showing the surrounding raw lines
- Log source switching now auto-selects that source's services (previously required a manual re-selection every time)

### Changed

- Web UI is now also reachable on port 80 in addition to the configurable `NGINX_PORT` (default 8888)
- New nginx HTTPS vhost (port 443, `acs.sc.sercomm.com`) relays factory-reset Sercomm radios — which hardcode this ACS URL — into the local GenieACS instance via DNS hijack, without needing to touch the radio's ACS config first
- SMS/IMS/Validation modules can now be hidden entirely at build time via `.env` flags (`ENABLE_SMS_MODULE`, `ENABLE_IMS_MODULE`, `ENABLE_VALIDATION_MODULE`) — requires a frontend rebuild to take effect
- Container timezone (`TZ`, default `America/New_York`) is now an explicit env var — several log parsers (Major Events classifier, FRR/GenieACS log streaming) depend on the container's local time matching the host's

### Known Issues / Follow-ups

- `backend/src/interfaces/rest/subscriber-groups-controller.ts`'s mutating routes are missing `requireAdmin` (every other admin-mutation route in this codebase has it) — any authenticated user, not just admins, can currently create/rename/delete subscriber groups. Low severity (doesn't touch real subscriber data) but should be fixed for consistency.
- The backend's `/var/run/docker.sock` mount changed from read-only to read-write — needs confirmation this is intentional before the next release.
- The `srsran4g/` Dockerfile (required for the 4G side of UE Validation) and a couple of other runtime-only paths were not yet committed to git as of this writing — check `git status` before relying on a fresh clone to have a working Validation module out of the box.

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.6] - 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Nav layout** — grouped all Layer 3 functionality (Routing, TUN Interfaces, Dummy Interfaces) under a single "L3 Routing" nav item instead of separate top-level pages
- **RF status detection** — improved logic for MosoLabs/Sercomm radios

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.5] - 2026-06-13

### Changed — TUN Interfaces

- Interfaces are now persisted via systemd-networkd `.netdev`/`.network` file pairs (`/etc/systemd/network/`) instead of one-shot systemd services — they now survive a reboot
- Removed the `ogstun[0-9]+` naming restriction — any valid Linux interface name is accepted (letter-start, max 15 chars, alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore)
- `checkNetworkdActive()` specifically checks that `systemd-networkd` is active on the host
- Interface listing now uses `ip link show type tun` for accurate TUN-only detection
- Edit/Delete actions are restricted to NMS-managed interfaces only

### Fixed — SAS Spectrum Chart

- Per-group filtering bug: `getSlotLayout()` now uses `effectiveGroupId()` so manually-assigned groups (e.g. a Nokia radio manually placed in a group) are correctly included in that band's chart row
- Frontend filter logic was inverted — radios with no `groupId` were bypassing group filters and appearing in every band row instead of none

### Docs

- Added chrony and `frr`/`frr-pythontools` to INSTALL.md prerequisites

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.4] - 2026-06-04

### Security — 10 vulnerabilities fixed

- **(CRITICAL)** `/sas/admin/*` was fully unauthenticated — split into `createSasProtocolRouter` (WInnForum CBSD endpoints only, no auth needed) and `createSasAdminRouter` (all admin routes, `requireAdmin` on every mutating endpoint)
- WebSocket server is now authenticated — moved from a standalone port 3002 to `noServer:true` on the HTTP server, with the Lucia session cookie validated on the upgrade request before the socket is accepted; unauthenticated connections get HTTP 401
- `requireAdmin` added to all three femtocell routes (derive-credentials, probe, provision)
- Python code injection eliminated in the femto controller — string-interpolated `pythonRun()` calls replaced with `execFileAsync` argv calls; strict MAC/IPv4 validation added
- `requireAdmin` added to all 11 mutating GenieACS routes
- SSRF fix in `/execute-tasks` — the client-supplied `url` field was removed from the task type; the URL is now always constructed server-side
- Sensitive-data routes (`/subscribers/export`, `/backup/full/download`, `/logs/download`, `/logs/debug-bundle`) now require admin
- Zip Slip prevention in backup restore — archive members are enumerated and validated (rejects absolute paths, `..` components, symlinks, hardlinks, devices) before extraction
- Shell injection fix in log-download tar — `bash -c` replaced with `execFileAsync` argv calls; container names validated against an allowlist
- Auth route ordering fix — `/logout` and `/me` were always returning 401 because the auth router was mounted before `authMiddleware`

### Fixed — FRR / L3 Routing

- Route filters not loading on refresh (`frrApi.getState()` return shape mismatch)
- EIGRP `distribute-list` isn't supported in FRR 8.4.x — switched to zebra-level `ip protocol eigrp route-map` for inbound filtering
- FRR restart used instead of reload when applying filters (`eigrpd` was crashing on SIGHUP with `distribute-list` present — a known FRR 8.4.4 bug)
- OSPF/BGP config generators now correctly wire route filters (were generated but never applied)
- Read-only "Active Configuration" summary card shown once migration is complete, replacing the editable form
- Live Routing Status redesigned: status badge, stat pills, neighbor cards, topology table, collapsible running-config panel
- Auto VSI filter button creates/updates an outbound permit filter directly from VSI mappings

### Other

- Full backup now includes `frr.conf` and `daemons`
- "Stop 5G" no longer stops SMF/UPF (shared between 4G and 5G in Open5GS 2.7+)
- Prometheus container now runs as `65534:65534`, fixing a `queries.active` permission-denied panic on restart

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.3] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **cert-init blocks nginx on fresh install** — The cert-init Docker service was failing with exit code 1 due to Docker Compose interpolating shell variables (`$SERVER_IP`, `$HOSTNAME`, `$expiry`, `$i`) in the inline entrypoint script as Compose variables (blank string). This caused nginx to never start since it `depends_on: cert-init: condition: service_completed_successfully`, making the entire web interface unreachable and preventing any user from logging in.
- **Inline script moved to `nginx/setup-sas-cert.sh`** — Mounted as a volume into the cert-init container. Docker Compose never interpolates file contents, only `docker-compose.yml` values directly.
- **Script rewritten as POSIX sh** — Was `#!/bin/bash` which is not available in the Alpine-based `alpine/openssl` container. Now `#!/bin/sh`.
- **Context detection** — Script detects whether it is running in the container (`/certs` volume mount exists) or on the host, and writes the cert to the correct location in both cases.
- **Skip logic** — Cert generation is skipped if `sas.crt` and `sas.key` already exist, preventing unnecessary regeneration on every `docker compose up`.
- **IP fallback** — Falls back to `127.0.0.1` if IP detection fails (was hardcoded to `172.16.0.168`).

### Workaround for existing broken installs

If nginx failed to start due to this issue, pre-generate the cert manually then restart:

```bash
mkdir -p nginx/certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout nginx/certs/sas.key \
  -out nginx/certs/sas.crt -days 3650 -nodes \
  -subj '/CN=sas.local' -addext 'subjectAltName=DNS:localhost'
docker compose up -d
```

### Fixed — Critical Baicells SAS Issues

This release resolves a series of root-cause bugs that prevented Baicells BaiBLQ firmware radios from transitioning from GRANTED to AUTHORIZED state in SAS mode 2. Radios were heartbeating indefinitely in GRANTED state and never enabling RF.

**Root Cause 1 — Timestamp format (PRIMARY FIX)**
- `sasFmt()` was producing compact UTC format (`20260603T025409UTC`). Baicells firmware silently ignores this format and leaves `SAS_CONFIG_TRANSEXPIRETIME` empty, so the radio's SAS client never knows when it can transmit.
- Fixed: `sasFmt()` now produces ISO 8601 Z format (`2026-06-03T02:54:09Z`), matching the WInnForum reference SAS (`fake_sas.py`) exactly.
- This is the primary fix — all other SAS protocol behavior depends on the radio parsing this timestamp correctly.

**Root Cause 2 — REM scan blocking OAM state machine**
- Baicells radios are factory-configured with `LTE_REM_SCAN_ON_BOOT=1` scanning Band 7 (2600 MHz).
- The OAM state machine requires `remScanDone=1` before it will allow `SAS_RADIO_ENABLE` to persist. Band 7 is never found in CBRS deployments, so `remScanDone` stays 0 forever.
- Any TR-069 write of `SAS_RADIO_ENABLE=1` is treated as a "dynamic configure" and immediately reset to 0 with the message `Now Nothing To Do For Dynamic Configure`.
- Fixed: provision tasks now push `Device.Services.FAPService.1.REM.LTE.ScanOnBoot=false`, `ScanPeriodically=false`, and `InServiceHandling=Disabled`. Also must be pushed manually to existing radios before reboot via GenieACS NBI.

**Root Cause 3 — Heartbeat response too verbose**
- Our heartbeat response included `heartbeatInterval` and `operationParam` fields. The WInnForum reference SAS returns only `cbsdId`, `grantId`, `transmitExpireTime`, and `response`.
- Extra fields were causing firmware to reject or misparse the response. Removed `heartbeatInterval` and `operationParam` from heartbeat responses to exactly match reference SAS behavior.

**Root Cause 4 — NTP clock skew**
- Radio clock was offset by up to 1 hour. `transmitExpireTime` was always in the radio's past, so the SAS client disabled RF immediately after every heartbeat.
- Fixed by configuring NTP server on each radio. The Time Server page (Chrony) enables setting a network-wide NTP source.
- Added `transmitExpireTime` debug log at level 20 showing calculated interval for diagnosis.

**Root Cause 5 — SAS.RadioEnable resets to False**
- In SAS mode 2, `SAS.RadioEnable` is a volatile parameter (`mibAttributeStorageClass=0`) controlled by the radio's SAS daemon, not TR-069.
- RF On/Off endpoint now also sets `Device.DeviceInfo.SAS.RadioEnable=true` when `sasEnableMode != 0`, in addition to `X_COM_RadioEnable`.
- Post-reboot provision task also sets `SAS.RadioEnable` conditionally.
- **Only set when SAS is enabled** — deployments without SAS are not affected.

### Fixed — SAS Protocol

- **Grant keeper** — Now catches grants where `grantExpireTime` is already in the past (previously only caught near-expiry). Renews `grantExpireTime` inline when renewing a grant.
- **Heartbeat handler expired grant** — No longer returns `TERMINATED_GRANT` when `grantExpireTime` is past and the radio is still heartbeating. Instead renews the grant inline, preventing unnecessary relinquish/re-register cycles.
- **`assignChannelSlot` null check** — `groupPolicy.customSlots` stored as `null` in MongoDB (not `undefined`) caused `null.length` crash. Fixed with `Array.isArray()` guard.
- **`UNSUPPORTED_SPECTRUM` on re-registration** — Radios hitting GPS delay window after reboot now wait the full 75 seconds correctly. Added info-level logging for GPS delay countdown.
- **Deterministic slot log** — `assignChannelSlot` logs at info level now (was trace) showing all serials in sort order for debugging.

### Fixed — RF On/Off Logic

- **`rf-all` endpoint** — Was fetching all devices with `projection=_id` only, then sending `X_COM_RadioEnable` to every device including Sercomm (which uses `AdminState`). Now fetches with `projection=_id,_deviceId,Device.DeviceInfo.SAS.enableMode` and filters to Baicells only (OUI `48BF74`).
- **Per-radio RF endpoint** — Now checks `SAS.enableMode` from GenieACS before deciding what to push. If SAS is enabled, also sets `SAS.RadioEnable`. If SAS is disabled, only sets `X_COM_RadioEnable`.
- **`rf-sercomm-all`** — Confirmed Sercomm-only (OUI `000E8F`). No changes to Sercomm RF logic.
- **Double POST bug** — RF endpoint was posting the task twice (silent + connection_request). Now sends once with `connection_request` only.

### Fixed — GenieACS Provisions

- **`default` provision** — Was declaring `InternetGatewayDevice.*` paths (TR-098 schema) hourly. Baicells uses `Device.*` (TR-181) so every inform produced a `9005 Invalid Parameter Names` fault. Replaced with a no-op comment.
- **`inform` provision** — Was declaring both `InternetGatewayDevice.*` and `Device.*` ManagementServer params, causing `too_many_commits` fault loop when `PeriodicInformInterval` differed from the provisioned value. Cleaned to `Device.*` only with `PeriodicInformInterval=5` matching what the NMS provisions.
- **GenieACS faults** — `9005` faults from `InternetGatewayDevice.*` params in the default provision stopped appearing after provision cleanup. Existing faults cleared via `db.faults.deleteMany({})`.
- **REM scan provision** — Added to `buildProvisionTasks()`: `FAPService.1.REM.LTE.ScanOnBoot=false`, `ScanPeriodically=false`, `InServiceHandling=Disabled`.
- **Post-reboot task** — Now includes `SAS.RadioEnable=true` when `sasEnableMode !== '0'`.

### Fixed — Spectrum Chart

- **Baicells grants not showing** — `getSlots` TypeScript return type in `frontend/src/api/sas.ts` was missing the `bands` array, so `slots.bands` was `undefined` in the frontend. Backend was returning correct data all along. Fixed type definition.
- **Slot matching overlap threshold** — Replaced exact boundary matching (`gLow >= s.low-1 && gHigh <= s.high+1`) with center-of-mass overlap matching (≥40% overlap). Handles Sercomm CA grants that don't align to Baicells slot boundaries.
- **Cross-group grant leakage** — Slot matching now filters grants by `assignedGroupIds` before matching, preventing Baicells grants from appearing in the Sercomm band chart and vice versa.
- **Unicode escape sequences** — `\u2013` (en dash) in JSX text content was rendering as literal `\u2013`. Replaced with actual `–` characters throughout `SASPage.tsx`.
- **Header button layout** — All SAS page header buttons (Verbose, Freq Debug, Refresh, Clear DB, Pause/Resume) now on a single line using `flex items-center gap-1.5`. Shortened button labels ("Verbose ON/OFF", "▶ Resume", "⏸ Pause").

### Fixed — Baicells Radio Card

- **EARFCN display in SAS mode 2** — Was showing TR-069 `EARFCNDL` value which is the provisioned value and never updated by the SAS daemon. Now calculates EARFCN from `sasReqLowFrequency` and `sasReqHighFrequency` center point, which reflects the actual SAS-granted frequency. All three radios now show their correct distinct EARFCNs (e.g. 55340, 55540, 55740).

### Added

- **Heartbeat transmit expire debug log** — Level 20 log on every heartbeat showing `heartbeatInterval`, `transmitExpireMs`, and calculated `transmitExpireTime`. Useful for diagnosing NTP clock skew issues.
- **GRANTED state debug log** — Level 20 log when a radio heartbeats with `operationState: GRANTED` (not yet transmitting), noting that `X_COM_RadioEnable` may be False.
- **`rf-all` now logs per-radio** — Each successful RF task logs `RF set on Baicells radio` at info level with device ID, enable state, and HTTP status.

### Changed

- **`sasFmt()` format** — Changed from `20260523T211500UTC` to `2026-05-23T21:15:00Z`. **Breaking change for any SAS client that expected compact UTC format**, but Baicells firmware was already rejecting the old format silently.
- **Heartbeat response** — Removed `heartbeatInterval` from response body. Removed `operationParam`. Only `cbsdId`, `grantId`, `transmitExpireTime`, `response`, and (when `grantRenew=true`) `grantExpireTime` are returned. Matches WInnForum `fake_sas.py` reference exactly.
- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta_0.2`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`

---

## [v2.0-beta_0.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

**📡 CBRS SAS — Multi-Band & Sercomm Integration**

- **Multi-band frequency configuration** — SAS Configuration tab now supports multiple independent frequency bands. Each band has a label, EARFCN or MHz range, and max grant bandwidth. Different radio hardware types can be assigned different bands (e.g. Baicells on 3560–3620 MHz, Sercomm on 3649–3700 MHz) without interfering with each other's slot assignments.

- **Three-level Band Assignment system** — New `sas_group_policies` and `sas_cbsd_policies` MongoDB collections. `resolveBand()` function in `SasService` applies priority: (1) per-CBSD override keyed by `fccId:serial` (survives Clear DB), (2) interference group policy keyed by `groupId`, (3) global `findMatchingBand()` fallback. Both `spectrumInquiry` and `grant` now use `resolveBand()` instead of `findMatchingBand()` directly.

- **Band Assignment tab** — New tab in the SAS page (renamed from "Band Policy" to "Band Assignment"). Three sections:
  - *Interference Groups* — shows each registered interference group with a band selector dropdown, member count, amber warning when no policy is set, slot preview showing member count vs available slots (green/red), and a slot assignment table showing which serial maps to which EARFCN within the chosen band
  - *Per-CBSD Overrides* — compact table showing all registered CBSDs with serial, FCC ID, group, and resolved band (with override/group/default source label). Edit button opens a fixed-position centered modal (prevents clipping in table rows) with band selector and notes field; ★ marks active overrides
  - *No Interference Group* — CBSDs without a coordination group, note to set per-CBSD override or use global default

- **Band policy REST endpoints** — Six new endpoints in `sas-controller.ts`:
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /sas/admin/policies/groups/:groupId`
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /sas/admin/policies/cbsds/:fccId/:serial`

- **Band policy frontend API** — Six new methods in `frontend/src/api/sas.ts`: `listGroupPolicies`, `setGroupPolicy`, `deleteGroupPolicy`, `listCbsdPolicies`, `setCbsdPolicy`, `deleteCbsdPolicy`

- **Unified spectrum chart** — New `UnifiedSpectrumChart` component renders all configured bands and all active grants on a single 3550–3700 MHz axis. Shows band background shading, unassigned slot hatching, active grant blocks with serial labels, band boundary lines, MHz tick marks every 10 MHz, and band name labels. Only shown when 2+ bands are configured. Per-band detail charts continue to show above it.

- **HTTPS SAS endpoint (port 8443)** — nginx now serves a second `server` block on port 8443 with TLS, proxying only `/sas/` paths. All other paths return 404. A new `cert-init` Docker service (`alpine/openssl` image) auto-generates a self-signed RSA-4096 certificate with correct SAN entries (server IP, hostname, `sas.local`, `localhost`) on first `docker compose up`. Certificate is written to `./nginx/certs/sas.crt` and `sas.key`. nginx `depends_on: cert-init: service_completed_successfully`. `nginx/certs/*.crt`, `*.key`, `*.pem` added to `.gitignore`; `nginx/certs/.gitkeep` tracks the empty directory.

- **Sercomm SCE4255W full SAS provisioning** — Complete rewrite of the Sercomm ACS module Location & SAS card. All previously hardcoded SAS parameters are now configurable form fields with correct defaults:
  - *Method* dropdown: Direct SAS (0) / Domain Proxy (1)
  - *Installation Method* dropdown: Single-Step (0, `CPIInstallParamSuppliedEnable=false`) / Multi-Step (1)
  - *Category* dropdown: A / B
  - *Channel Type* dropdown: GAA / PAL (`ProtectionLevel`)
  - *Location* dropdown: Indoor / Outdoor
  - *Location Source* dropdown: Manual (0) / GPS (1) (`HighAccuracyLocationEnable`)
  - *Height Type* dropdown: AGL / AMSL
  - *Lat/Long* in decimal degrees — auto-converted to microdegrees on push (multiply × 1,000,000)
  - *SAS User ID* (`UserContactInformation`)
  - *SAS Server URL* (defaults to `https://<hostname>:8443/sas/v1.2`)
  - *Manufacturer Prefix* checkbox (prepends `Sercomm-` to serial, default checked)
  - *CPI Required* checkbox (Cat B outdoor only, default unchecked)
  - *Verify SAS Cert* checkbox (`PeerCertVerifyEnable`, default unchecked for self-signed)
  - *Enable SAS* checkbox
  - Also sets: `ManufacturerPrefixEnable`, `UserIDSelectMethod=0`, `HighAccuracyLatitude`, `HighAccuracyLongitude`, `HighAccuracyLocationEnable`, `CPIEnable`, `CPIInstallParamSuppliedEnable`
  - `sasServerUrl` and `sasPeerCertVerify` added to `SercommProvisionInput` type in both backend and frontend

- **SAS Log filter** — "Filter by CBSD ID" text input on the Logs tab filters displayed lines client-side by any string (CBSD ID, serial, IP, response code).

- **Quiet docker compose logs** — Per-request SAS protocol traffic (`spectrumInquiry`, `grant`, `heartbeat` requests and responses, band resolution, slot assignment, duplicate grant, grant keeper renewal) downgraded from `info` to `trace` level. `startSummaryLogger(30_000)` started in `index.ts` alongside grant keeper; every 30 seconds logs one clean line: `SAS ─ N active grants: \u25cf <serial> <low>-<high>MHz EARFCN:<n>`. `stopSummaryLogger()` called on graceful shutdown.

### Fixed

- **Per-CBSD override modal clipped** — `CbsdPolicyEditor` popover changed from `absolute` positioning (clipped by table overflow) to `fixed` modal centered with `top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`. Transparent backdrop closes on click-outside.

- **Spectrum chart unicode escape sequences** — `\u2013` (en dash), `\u25cf` (bullet), `\u00b7` (middle dot) inside template literals were rendered as literal escape text. Replaced with direct UTF-8 characters.

- **Sercomm `HeightType`** — Was hardcoded to `AMSL`. Corrected to `AGL` (WInnForum CBSD spec requirement for indoor Cat A deployments) as the default, now user-configurable.

- **Sercomm lat/long format** — `HighAccuracyLatitude` and `HighAccuracyLongitude` were not being set at all. Now set from form lat/long fields converted to microdegrees.

- **SAS `spectrumInquiry` returning all bands** — Previously returned all configured bands as available channels. Now returns only the CBSD's resolved band (via `resolveBand()`), preventing Sercomm radios from being offered Baicells-only slots.

- **Sercomm SSL connect error** — Radio was configured with `https://172.16.0.168:8888/sas/v1.2` (HTTP port). Fixed by updating default SAS URL to port 8443 and adding a validation note in the form.

- **`useMemo` not imported** — `BandPolicyTab` used `useMemo` but it wasn't in the React import in `SASPage.tsx`. Added to import.

- **`isShared` unused variable** — Removed unused `isShared` variable from slot table row renderer in `BandPolicyTab`.

- **`sasServerUrl` not in `SercommProvisionInput`** — Added as optional field to type in `genieacs.ts` to fix TypeScript build error.

### Changed

- **SAS tab renamed** — "Band Policy" tab renamed to "Band Assignment" for clarity
- **`getSlotLayout()`** — Now returns all configured bands (not just first band) as a `bands` array with per-band slot data. Legacy flat fields (`bandLow`, `bandHigh`, `slotWidthHz`, `slots`) preserved for backward compatibility.
- **`findMatchingBand()`** — Still used as fallback in `resolveBand()` for global default; no longer called directly from `spectrumInquiry` or `grant`
- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta_0.1`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`

---

## [v2.0-beta] - 2026-05-27

### Added

**📡 CBRS SAS Server**
- Full built-in WInnForum SAS-CBSD protocol server implementing the complete CBRS interface: registration, spectrumInquiry, grant, heartbeat, relinquishment, deregistration
- Deterministic per-CBSD channel assignment keyed by `cbsdSerialNumber` sort order within interference coordination group — race-condition-proof, survives re-registrations and Clear DB cycles
- Interference coordination group support (`groupType: INTERFERENCE_COORDINATION`) — radios in the same group are automatically spread across non-overlapping 20 MHz frequency slots
- Multi-site scaling — independent slot assignment per group ID; multiple sites can reuse the same physical frequencies without conflict
- GPS delay enforcement — configurable lock delay (default 75 s, keyed per `fccId:serial`) before grants are issued, ensuring radios are GPS-locked before transmitting
- Grants issued directly as `AUTHORIZED` (not `GRANTED`) so radios enable RF immediately on first grant response without waiting for a heartbeat cycle
- `Pause SAS` / `Resume SAS` toggle button — when paused, all SAS protocol endpoints return `DEREGISTER`/`TERMINATED_GRANT`; radios stop transmitting without any data being deleted. Red banner shown on dashboard when paused.
- `Clear DB` button — wipes all grants and CBSDs from MongoDB and clears GPS delay clocks; radios re-register and get fresh deterministic slot assignments on next contact
- Spectrum chart — visual frequency band display with color-coded slots, EARFCN labels, and per-CBSD assignment table showing which serial maps to which slot
- SAS admin REST API: `POST /sas/admin/reset`, `POST /sas/admin/pause`, `POST /sas/admin/resume`, `GET /sas/admin/status`, `GET /sas/admin/slots`
- SAS config page — band low/high EARFCN, max grant bandwidth, GPS lock delay, heartbeat interval, default max EIRP
- MongoDB-backed CBSD and grant persistence

**📡 Baicells eNodeB Provisioning**
- Full Band 42/43/48 band selector with auto-fill button for band-appropriate defaults
- EARFCN dropdown per band — in SAS mode 2 the EARFCN field is greyed out and labeled `(SAS)` since the radio tunes to the SAS-granted frequency
- EARFCN mismatch warning when configured EARFCN doesn't match the expected SAS-assigned slot center frequency
- All SAS TR-069 parameters provisioned: `SAS.enableMode`, `SAS.RadioEnable`, `SAS.ServerUrl`, `SAS.UserId`, `SAS.CallSign`, `SAS.FccId`, `SAS.groupType`, `SAS.groupId`, `SAS.LegacyMode`, `SAS.RegistrationType`, `SAS.reqLowFrequency`, `SAS.reqHighFrequency`, `SAS.PreferredFrequency`, `SAS.PreferredBandwidth`, `SAS.PreferredPower`, `SAS.MaxEIRP`, `SAS.EirpCapability`
- RF enable sends task twice (queued + connection_request) to ensure immediate effect
- `rfStatus` correctly derived from `X_COM_RadioEnable AND opState` (not just RadioEnable)
- EARFCN not pushed to radio in SAS mode 2 (radio tunes to SAS grant automatically)

**🔗 Remote UPF / SGW-U Architecture (4G + 5G Edge Deployments)**
- **Remote UPF config generator** (UPF config page, Section 2) — enter remote site PFCP and GTP-U addresses, DNN, session pool, DNS; generates ready-to-deploy `upf.yaml`; "Add to SMF & Apply" button wires the remote UPF into `smf.yaml` PFCP client list automatically; full deployment steps included
- **SMF config page** (fully rewritten) — UPF routing table showing local UPF (labeled "same host") and remote UPF entries; routing criteria: DNN, TAC (decimal), eNodeB Cell ID (hex, 28-bit), NR Cell ID (hex, 36-bit); routing destination badge on session pools showing which UPF handles each pool; routable SMF PFCP address selector; "Remove All Remote UPFs" bulk action
- **Remote SGW-U config generator** (SGW-U config page, Section 2) — mirrors UPF generator exactly; generates ready-to-deploy `sgwu.yaml` with SGW-C address, PFCP server, and GTP-U server; deployment steps for `open5gs-sgwu` on remote host
- **SGW-C config page** (fully rewritten) — SGW-U routing table with local SGW-U (labeled "same host") and remote SGW-U entries; routing criteria: TAC, APN, Cell ID (e_cell_id, hex); routable SGW-C PFCP server section; "Remove All Remote SGW-Us" bulk action
- Cross-navigation: "Edit in Generator" button on SMF/SGW-C routing entries navigates to UPF/SGW-U tab and pre-populates the generator form
- "How it works" topology button on SMF and SGW-C pages — opens modal with network diagram, key point cards (control plane / PFCP / user plane), IP requirements callout
- Network topology diagram (SVG) embedded inline — central site (AMF, MME, SMF, SGW-C) ↔ edge site (UPF, SGW-U) with all interface IPs, PFCP/N4/Gxc connections, N2/S1-MME control plane (dashed), N3/S1-U user plane; clean orthogonal routing, no crossing lines
- `sgwc.yaml` and `sgwu.yaml` added to auto-config backup list and service restart list

**⚙️ Auto-Config improvements**
- "Use Local UPF Only" checkbox (default checked) — hides PFCP addressing complexity for single-server deployments; shows loopback summary `127.0.0.4 ↔ 127.0.0.7`; auto-detects from existing `smf.yaml` pfcp.client.upf list
- `mergePfcpServers()` helper function — prevents duplicate IP entries in PFCP server lists for SMF, UPF, and SGW-C; deduplicates existing entries; replaces all previous ad-hoc dedup logic
- `localUpfOnly` and `localSgwuOnly` flags — when true, forces loopback defaults regardless of any IP fields entered
- SGW-C PFCP auto-config — when `localSgwuOnly: true`, sets `127.0.0.3` as SGW-C PFCP server and `127.0.0.6` as SGW-U client

**🧪 Unit Tests (Jest)**
- 32 unit tests for RAN UE session reporting in `backend/src/__tests__/active-sessions.test.ts`
- Coverage: 4G/5G UE detection, IMSI field variants (`supi` vs `imsi`, `imsi-` prefixed vs bare), UE deduplication, live eNodeB/gNodeB filter (setup_success), Prometheus metrics fallback, interface status (S1-MME, S1-U, N2, N3)
- `parsePeerIP` helper tests (bracketed IPv4, bracketed IPv6, plain `IP:port`, bare IP)
- `ts-jest` and `@types/jest` added to backend devDependencies; `jest` config added to `backend/package.json`
- Dockerfile updated to always use `npm install` (no lock file sync issues)

### Fixed

- **RAN page crash** — `mmeUe.supi` null guard added with fallback to `imsi` field for Open5GS versions that use `imsi` instead of `supi`. Crash was dropping all 4G UEs from display after the first malformed entry.
- **RAN page live eNodeB filter too strict** — `setup_success: false` was causing `liveEnbIps` to be empty, silently dropping all 4G UEs. Filter now only skips UEs whose specific radio IP is absent from the live set; UEs with unresolvable radio IPs pass through.
- **RAN page 5G-only deployment** — `getActive4GUEs()` now short-circuits immediately when both MME `/ue-info` and `/enb-info` return empty (no MME running), avoiding redundant SMF PDU queries and a redundant `getActive5GUEs()` dedup call
- **Services page Stop 4G / Stop 5G** — Express route order bug: `/:name/:action` was matching before `/all/:action`. Fixed by registering `/all/:action` first in `service-controller.ts` and `sas-controller.ts`.
- **SGW-C and SGW-U metrics sections removed** — Neither service exposes a Prometheus metrics HTTP endpoint. Metrics blocks removed from `SgwcEditor.tsx` and `SgwuEditor.tsx`.
- **Duplicate PFCP server IP (auto-config)** — Entering a loopback address already present in the YAML created a duplicate `pfcp.server` entry. `mergePfcpServers()` helper prevents this for all services and self-heals existing duplicates.
- **SAS double EARFCN grants** — Previous slot assignment was sorting CBSDs by `cbsdId` (UUID, changes on re-registration) causing position instability. Changed to sort by `cbsdSerialNumber` which is hardware-bound and never changes. Also removed PENDING grant placeholder approach (race-prone) in favor of pure deterministic serial sort.
- **SAS RadioEnable not set** — Grants were issued as `GRANTED` requiring a heartbeat to become `AUTHORIZED` before `SAS.RadioEnable` goes true. Changed to issue grants directly as `AUTHORIZED` since GPS delay is already satisfied by grant time.

### Changed

- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`
- **SAS slot assignment** — switched from `cbsdId` sort key to `cbsdSerialNumber` sort key for stable, hardware-bound slot assignment
- **`getActive4GUEs()` signature** — accepts optional `imsi5GSet?: Set<string>` parameter; when provided by `GetInterfaceStatus`, skips the internal `getActive5GUEs()` call to avoid redundant API requests
- **`GetInterfaceStatus.execute()`** — now runs `getActive5GUEs()` first, passes resulting IMSI set to `getActive4GUEs(imsi5GSet)` eliminating the double 5G API call
- **`TopologyModal`** — new shared component (`TopologyModal.tsx`) with inline SVG topology diagram, key point cards, IP requirements callout; used by both SmfEditor and SgwcEditor
- **README** — added CBRS SAS section with feature list and screenshot placeholders; updated latest release section to v2.0-beta

---

## [v1.3.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Radio nickname tags** — Tag any eNodeB or gNodeB IP with a friendly name (e.g. "Site A gNB", "Lab eNB"). Tags stored in SQLite (`radio_tags` table), persist across sessions, visible to all users. Admins edit inline on the RAN Network page (pencil icon on hover, Enter to save, empty = delete).
  - `SqliteRadioTagRepository` — new repository sharing the existing auth SQLite DB (`getDb()` exposed on `SqliteAuthRepository`)
  - `radio-tags-controller.ts` — `GET /api/radio-tags` (all users), `PUT /api/radio-tags/:ip` and `DELETE /api/radio-tags/:ip` (admin only)
  - `radio_tags` table added to `sqlite-auth-repository.ts` `initSchema()`
  - `radioTagsApi` added to frontend `api/index.ts`
- **UE nicknames on RAN Network page** — Subscriber nicknames (set on Subscriber page) now appear below the IMSI in both per-radio UE sub-rows and the All Sessions table. Enriched at the backend by batch-fetching nicknames from MongoDB after building the active UE list.
  - `getNicknamesByImsi(imsis)` added to `MongoSubscriberRepository` and `ISubscriberRepository` interface
  - `getActive5GUEs()` and `getActive4GUEs()` in `active-sessions.ts` now enrich each `ActiveUE` with `nickname` from MongoDB
  - `ActiveUE` interface: `nickname?: string` added in both backend and frontend
- **RAN Network page — wider layout** — Container widened from `max-w-7xl` (1280px) to `max-w-[1600px]`. Table cell padding tightened from `px-4 py-3` to `px-3 py-2.5`. IMSI and Radio columns given `min-w` so nicknames have room to breathe.

### Fixed
- **Femtocell — password/username re-probe on blur** — WebUI Username and WebUI Password fields now call `probeDevice(cfg.ip)` on blur when an IP is already entered. Previously the user had to retype the IP after entering credentials to re-trigger the probe.
- **MongoDB log spam suppressed** — `systemctl is-active mongod` failures are now logged at `debug` (not `error`) since they are expected when MongoDB runs in Docker. MongoDB Docker probe info logs throttled to once per 15 minutes (was every 5 seconds).
- **TUN interface creation — IP not assigned** — `ip addr add` was returning exit 0 but the address never appeared on the interface. Root cause: `executeCommand` (nsenter `-m`) enters the host mount namespace but not the host network namespace. Fix: use `executeLocalCommand` with explicit `nsenter --net=/proc/1/ns/net` for all `ip` commands. Confirmed working.
- **TUN interface creation — networkctl race** — `networkctl reload` after `ip addr add` caused systemd-networkd to flush and reassign the address, creating a race where `list()` ran during the flush window and saw no address. `networkctl reload` removed from the create/edit flow. Persistence handled exclusively by a systemd oneshot service at `/etc/systemd/system/open5gs-tun-<name>.service`.
- **TUN interface state detection** — State now derived from the `<...,UP>` flags field in `ip -o link show` output, not the `state UP` keyword. TUN interfaces with `NO-CARRIER` always show `state DOWN` even when the UP flag is set, so the previous logic always reported them as down even after `ip link set up`.
- **TUN interface — not detected as created** — `exists` was derived from `liveMap` which was built from `ip addr` output and only populated when an IPv4 was assigned. Interfaces without a yet-assigned IP were reported as `NOT CREATED`. Fixed: `exists` now derived from `ip link` output which lists all interfaces regardless of IP.
- **SMF/UPF — local UPF routing label missing** — SMF Session Pools now show a green "↗ Local UPF" badge for all pools with no matching remote UPF DNN rule (including the default no-DNN pool). Previously only remote UPF pools showed a routing destination badge.
- **YAML round-trip safety (all 16 NFs)** — `saveRaw()` in `yaml-config-repository.ts` now reads the current on-disk YAML before every write and deep-merges the incoming doc over it using `deepMerge(base, overlay)`. Unknown fields (manually added `dev:` bindings, custom `session` entries, extra top-level keys, timer sections) are preserved. Arrays are replaced not merged so deleting a session pool via the UI still works. Frontend editors for AMF NGAP server, MME S1AP server, and SGW-C GTP-C server fixed to spread existing server entries (preserving unknown sibling keys) rather than creating bare replacement objects.
- **SMF session pool ordering** — `auto-config.ts` `execute()` now sorts SMF session pools: DNN-specific pools first, default (no-DNN) pools last. Open5GS matches pools top-to-bottom and crashes on unknown DNN if the default pool appears before a named one.

### Changed
- **Tests infrastructure** — `tests/yaml-round-trip.test.ts` updated with correct run command (via backend container). `tests/run-tests.sh` one-shot script and `tests/README.md` added.
- **`iproute2` added to backend Dockerfile** — Required for `ip tuntap`, `ip addr`, `ip link` commands used by the TUN management use case.

---

## [v1.3.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Topology — UE overflow popup panels** — Active 4G UE Sessions and Active 5G UE Sessions boxes now cap at 3 UEs displayed inline. If more than 3 UEs are active, a clickable "+ N more — click to view all" button appears at the bottom of the JointJS box. Clicking it opens a draggable floating panel (positioned absolutely over the canvas) showing all UEs with IP and IMSI. Panel is draggable by its header, auto-sizes to fit all UEs (max 400px scrollable), and has a close button. Separate panels for 4G and 5G.
- **RAN Network page — sortable UE sessions table** — IMSI, UE IP, and DNN/APN columns are now sortable. Clicking a header sorts ascending; clicking again toggles descending. Active sort column shows ↑↓ arrow indicator; inactive columns show ⇅. Sort is client-side in-memory — no API call.
- **Subscriber page — sortable columns** — IMSI, UE IPv4, and APN columns are now sortable. Sort is fully client-side (frontend `useMemo` sort) — no backend aggregation pipeline. Instant response with no page refetch. Clicking same column toggles asc/desc; clicking new column resets to asc.
- **Services page — 4G/5G group toggle buttons** — Two new toggle buttons in the services page header: blue "Start/Stop 5G" and amber "Start/Stop 4G". Each button reads the current running state and toggles accordingly. MongoDB is excluded from both groups. Backed by new optional `services` filter parameter on `POST /api/services/all/:action`.
- **Remote UPF management (UPF tab)** — New `UpfEditor.tsx` component with three sections:
  - **Local UPF** — edits `upf.yaml`, clearly labelled as the UPF on this host. Loopback warning on GTP-U address.
  - **SMF → UPF Connections** — edits `smf.yaml pfcp.client.upf` as a multi-entry list. Add/remove remote UPFs. Colour-coded local (green) vs remote (blue). Saves to `smf.yaml` on Apply Changes.
  - **Remote UPF YAML Generator** — Fill in PFCP and GTP-U addresses, session pool, DNS. Generates a ready-to-deploy `upf.yaml` for the remote machine. Copy/download buttons. "Add to SMF UPF List" button. Deployment instructions included. Auto-fills SMF real routable IP from config.
- **SMF config — DNN field on session pools** — Session pool rows now have a third `DNN (optional)` field alongside Subnet and Gateway.
- **SMF config — dual PFCP server addresses** — SMF PFCP server section now has two address fields: loopback (keep for local UPF) and optional real IP (for remote UPF to connect back to). Both are written to `smf.yaml pfcp.server[]`.
- **SBI Client defaults** — NRF URI defaults to `http://127.0.0.10:7777` and SCP URI defaults to `http://127.0.0.200:7777` when fields are empty.

### Fixed
- **Topology — MongoDB status light always red** — `mongodb` was not in the topology services list, so `statuses?.['mongodb']` was always `undefined` → always red regardless of actual state. Fixed by adding `mongodb` to the topology node list. Additionally, the topology endpoint now performs a **live** `getMongoStatus()` call (TCP ping + docker ps) on every topology load rather than relying on the polling cache.
- **Topology — MongoDB Docker detection** — `getServiceStatus()` was calling `isServiceActive()` which returns `false` without throwing when the systemd unit doesn't exist. The Docker fallback was in the `catch` block and never ran. Fixed: for `mongodb`, if `isServiceActive()` returns `false` (regardless of whether it throws), immediately call `getMongoDockerStatus()` before reporting inactive.
- **Topology — background dots removed** — `drawGrid: true` in JointJS paper config was rendering a dot grid over the canvas. Changed to `drawGrid: false`. Removed now-unused `drawGridSize` and `gridPattern` options.
- **Topology — thin grey border around map removed** — The container div had `border border-nms-border` class which drew a visible line around the entire topology canvas. Removed the border classes.
- **Log download — Docker tab greyed out** — The Docker Containers button in `LogDownloadModal` was hardcoded `disabled` with a `cursor-not-allowed` style. Removed the `disabled` attribute and made it a fully functional tab.
- **Log download — Docker containers not populated on modal open** — The download modal received `dockerContainers` as a prop from `LogsPage`, but `LogsPage` only fetched containers when the user had already clicked the Docker tab. Opening the download modal directly showed an empty container list. Fixed by adding a `useEffect` in `LogDownloadModal` that fetches containers from `/api/docker/containers` on mount, independent of the parent.
- **Log download — Docker containers not populated on main log page** — `LogsPage` only fetched containers when `logSource === 'docker'`. Changed to fetch on mount unconditionally so all containers are shown immediately.
- **Log download — all containers filtered to open5gs-nms only** — `DockerLogExecutor.getContainers()` used `--filter name=open5gs-nms`, hiding MongoDB and other containers. Removed the filter so all running containers are returned.
- **Log download — Docker logs using nsenter** — Docker log fetching was calling `executeCommand('bash', ['-c', 'docker logs ...'])` which routes through `nsenter`, causing failures. Changed to `spawn('docker', [...])` directly — the same approach used by the Unified Logs module which already works. `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted into the container.
- **Log download — tar source directory not found** — Log files were being written to the host `/tmp` via `nsenter` but `tar` was running inside the container's `/tmp`. These are different filesystems. Fixed by using `fs.readFile`/`fs.writeFile` directly (since `/var/log/open5gs` and `/etc/open5gs` are mounted into the container) and running `tar` locally inside the container where all temp files exist.
- **SD values written with quotes in YAML** — `yaml-config-repository.ts` post-processing was enforcing `sd: "000001"` (with quotes). Open5GS config style uses unquoted SD values. The load side (`fixMccMncSdFromRawYaml`) already handles both forms on read. Fixed: post-processing now strips quotes → writes `sd: 000001` unquoted. Applies to AMF, SMF, and NSSF since all go through the same `saveRaw()` method.
- **Subscriber sort not working** — Sort was implemented as a MongoDB aggregation pipeline with `$addFields` + `$ifNull` on nested array fields. This was unreliable for missing/null values and added latency. Moved sorting entirely to the frontend: `fetchSubscribers()` always fetches in default IMSI order; `sortedSubscribers = useMemo(...)` sorts the current page in-memory using `localeCompare` with `numeric: true`. No backend changes needed per sort action.
- **403 permission denied — viewer could restart services and change configs** — `requireAdmin` middleware was missing from `service-controller` (POST routes), `config-controller` (validate/apply/sync-sd), `auto-config-controller` (preview/apply), `suci-controller` (all write routes), and `backup-controller` (all 11 write routes). Fixed by adding `requireAdmin` to every write route in every controller.
- **403 permission denied toast** — Added a 403 interceptor in the axios response interceptor that shows a `🔒 Permission denied` toast for any 403 response. Uses `id: 'forbidden'` to deduplicate.

### Changed
- **Topology — UE boxes capped at 3** — Both Active 4G UE Sessions and Active 5G UE Sessions boxes render a maximum of 3 UE cards inline. Overflow shown via the popup panel (see Added above). Box height stays fixed regardless of UE count.
- **Config page — SMF PFCP UPF field** — The single UPF address input in the SMF tab is now a read-only display showing current UPF list with a note "Manage in UPF tab". Full UPF list management moved to the UPF configuration tab.
- **Subscriber table** — Added APN and UE IPv4 columns. Removed session_count column. Sortable IMSI, APN, UE IPv4 headers.
- **MongoDB status source field** — `ServiceStatus` and frontend `ServiceStatus` type both now carry `source?: 'systemd' | 'docker' | 'direct'`. Services page shows a blue "docker" badge next to MONGODB when detected via Docker.
- **`SubscriberListItem`** — Added `ue_ipv4?: string` and `apn?: string` fields (backend entity + frontend type). These are extracted from the first session of the first slice and included in list projections.

### CHANGELOG
- v1.3.4 entries (MongoDB Docker detection, subscriber sorting, Docker container list fix, log download Docker tab fix) retroactively merged into v1.3.5 as all were part of the same development cycle.

---

## [v1.3.3] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Viewer role (read-only access)** — New `viewer` user role that can monitor everything but cannot make any changes. Admins can create viewer accounts and toggle existing users between admin and viewer from the User Management page.
  - Role selector on user create form (Admin / Viewer)
  - Role badges on user table (Shield = Admin, Eye = Viewer)
  - "Make Viewer / Make Admin" toggle button per user
  - Prevents demoting yourself or the last admin account
  - Amber "View-only mode" banner shown at top of every page for viewer sessions
  - All write routes on backend protected with `requireAdmin` middleware
- **403 permission denied toast** — When a viewer (or anyone) hits a protected endpoint, a `🔒 Permission denied` toast appears instead of a silent failure. Uses `id: 'forbidden'` to deduplicate multiple simultaneous 403s.
- **Subscriber CSV export** — `GET /api/subscribers/export?format=csv` streams all subscribers as a CSV file. Available to all users including viewers. Columns: `imsi, nickname, iccid, msisdn, ki, opc, amf, sst, sd, apn, type, ue_ipv4, ue_ipv6`.
- **Subscriber CSV import** — `POST /api/subscribers/import` (admin only). Accepts CSV with `{csv, mode}` where mode is `skip` (default) or `overwrite`. Returns `{imported, skipped, overwritten, errors[]}`. Import button with mode selector on Subscriber page.
- **Femtocell beta warning banner** — Red banner at top of Femtocell Provisioning tab indicating the module is under active development.
- **SUCI dual key format display** — Each key now shows two copyable formats:
  - Profile A (X25519): Raw 64-hex (Open5GS UDM) and `04`-prefixed 66-hex (SIM tools)
  - Profile B (secp256r1): Compressed 66-hex (Open5GS UDM) and uncompressed 130-hex (SIM tools)

### Fixed
- **Viewer role write access bug** — `requireAdmin` middleware was added to the `users-controller` but was missing from `service-controller`, `config-controller`, `auto-config-controller`, `suci-controller`, and `backup-controller`. Viewers could restart services and change configs. All write routes in all controllers now correctly enforce admin-only access.
- **Subscriber CSV import `ambr` validation error** — `rowToSubscriber` was missing the required top-level `ambr` field on the subscriber document. Open5GS schema requires `ambr` at both the subscriber level and the session level. Import was failing with `ambr: required` on every row.
- **Subscriber CSV import session type** — Import was hardcoding `type: 3` (IPv4v6). Now reads from the `type` CSV column and defaults to `1` (IPv4) if blank. Supports all three values: `1` = IPv4, `2` = IPv6, `3` = IPv4v6.
- **Subscriber CSV import IPv6 address** — Added `ue_ipv6` column to CSV. Import correctly builds `ue: { ipv4, ipv6 }` object with only the fields that are populated.
- **`UserRole` type** — Domain entity `UserRole` was typed as `'admin'` only, causing TypeScript to reject `'viewer'` everywhere it flowed through. Fixed to `'admin' | 'viewer'`.
- **`SafeUser` missing `createdAt`** — Frontend was casting `(u as any).createdAt` because the field was absent from the `SafeUser` interface. Added to interface and `toSafeUser()` mapper.

### Changed
- **User Management page** — Rewritten to include role management, role badges, and improved UX. Role selector on create form. Toggle button per user. Prevents self-demotion and removing last admin.
- **Subscriber page** — Export CSV button always visible (including viewer). Import CSV, Add, Edit, Delete, SIM Generator, and Auto-Assign IPs hidden for viewer role.
- **CSV format** — Added `type`, `ue_ipv4`, `ue_ipv6` columns. Removed `ul_mbps`, `dl_mbps` (not used by Open5GS). All values now round-trip correctly through export → import.

---

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Femtocell provisioning success detection** — Replaced brittle 3-string `allOk` check with correct logic. Previous check required `[+] OK  sasConf` even when SAS was disabled, causing every non-SAS provision to report failure. Corrected string matching to include `.htm` suffixes. Added conditional sasConf check and `noFailures` fallback.
- **Femtocell output panel color** — Red/green border and icon now key off `[-] FAILED` (exact script failure marker) instead of `FAILED`. Reboot wait `[!]` warning lines no longer turn the panel red on a successful provision.
- **Femtocell error toast duration** — Extended to 8 seconds with "Check output for details" so the output panel is readable before the toast disappears.
- **Femtocell probe config regression** — A failed attempt to fix checkbox detection via a `--probe-config` subcommand introduced Python syntax errors and corrupted the inline regex strings in the probe Step 3 block (`{{name}}` double-braces and stray `]` characters broke rf-string interpolation). Rolled back both `femto-controller.ts` and `femto_provision.py` to the v1.3.1 working state. The probe correctly pulls and pre-fills all text fields; checkbox pre-fill (Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, Auto Internal Neighbors) remains a known issue for a future fix.
- **SUCI Profile A SIM provisioning key** — Removed incorrect `04` prefix from X25519 public key. X25519 keys are raw 32 bytes (64 hex) with no point-compression prefix. The `04` prefix is secp256r1 uncompressed-point notation and is invalid for X25519. Both Open5GS UDM and SIM provisioning tools (pySIM, sysmoUSIM) use the same raw 32-byte format for Profile A.

### Added
- **SUCI dual key display** — KeyCard now shows two separate copyable keys per entry:
  - **Open5GS UDM Key** — compressed/raw format for `udm.yaml` hnet block
  - **SIM Provisioning Key** — format required by pySIM/sysmoUSIM when programming eSIMs
  - Profile B (secp256r1): UDM shows compressed 66 hex, SIM tools show uncompressed 130 hex
  - Profile A (X25519): both show the same raw 64-hex value with a label clarifying they are identical
  - Each key has its own Copy button; sublabels show exact byte format and length per profile

### Changed
- **`HnetKey` frontend type** — Added `publicKeyUncompressed: string | null` field to match the backend (which already returned this value).
- **SUCI usage info** — KeyCard usage blurb now references correct `scheme` and `id` values inline for both key types.

### Known Issues
- **Femtocell probe checkboxes** — Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, and Auto Internal Neighbors always show unchecked on probe regardless of device state. Root cause: Sercomm omits the checkbox `<input>` element when unchecked (standard HTML), so the `checked`-attribute regex always returns false. Fix requires reading the `h_<field>` hidden inputs instead. Deferred.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Port conflict with FoHSS IMS HSS** — Frontend internal port changed from 8080 to 8081. FoHSS (IMS Home Subscriber Server used in VoLTE setups) also binds port 8080, causing the frontend container to fail to start. Updated `frontend/Dockerfile`, `nginx/nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example`.

### Improved
- **Femtocell probe** — Probe endpoint now uses Python `requests` instead of Node.js `https` module. Node TLS rejects old Sercomm self-signed certificates; Python handles them correctly.
- **Femtocell reboot wait** — `wait_for_webui_reboot` and `wait_for_webui_up` no longer call `sys.exit(1)` on timeout. Reboot wait is now best-effort — script exits 0 if all config pages saved successfully, regardless of reboot timing. Timeouts increased from 300s to 600s.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Femtocell Provisioning tab** (Auto Config page) — Full provisioning UI for Sercomm SCE4255W CBRS small cells
  - Auto-detects WebUI status on IP field blur
  - Automatically fetches MAC via `sc_femto` SSH and derives credentials using calc_f2 algorithm
  - Pulls and pre-fills current device config from `devComState.htm`
  - Configures radio (Band 48 dual-carrier defaults), S1/core, SAS/location, and CWMP settings
  - MME IP auto-populated from Open5GS MME config
  - Browser geolocation support for SAS lat/long (micro-degrees format)
  - Dry run and live provision with full script output displayed on completion
  - `femto_provision.py` bundled in backend Docker image at `/app/tools/`
  - Backend endpoints: `GET /api/femto/probe`, `POST /api/femto/provision`
- **Auto Config page tabs** — "Open5GS Auto Config" and "Femtocell Provisioning" tabs

### Fixed
- **Service restart logout bug** — `window.location.reload()` after service actions replaced with `fetchStatuses()`. Page reload was dropping the session cookie on HTTP connections where `secure:true` cookies are silently ignored by the browser.
- **COOKIE_SECURE env var** — Was declared in `.env.example` but never read by the application. Now properly wired through `config/index.ts` → `createLucia()` → session cookie attributes.
- **GLIBC mismatch on Ubuntu 24.04** — `nsenter` now passes bare command names instead of full paths (e.g. `systemctl` not `/usr/bin/systemctl`). Node resolves full paths before `nsenter` runs, picking up container binaries that require an older GLIBC. Bare names resolve after entering the host mount namespace, using the host's own binaries and GLIBC. Fixes `GLIBC_2.39 not found` error reported on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble.
- **pySIM bundled** — Removed `git clone` of pysim from Dockerfile. `suci-keytool.py` and `osmocom/` package now bundled directly in `backend/tools/`. Eliminates build-time dependency on `gitea.osmocom.org`.

### Changed
- **nginx** — Added `/api/femto/` location block with `proxy_buffering off` and 700s timeout, placed before `/api/` block to ensure correct routing.
- **Dockerfile** — Added `paramiko` and `requests` to pip install for `femto_provision.py`.

---

## [v1.2.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Session logout on service restart** — Replaced `window.location.reload()` with `fetchStatuses()` in `ServicesPage.tsx`.
- **COOKIE_SECURE** — Added `cookieSecure` field to `AppConfig`, read from `COOKIE_SECURE` env var (default `false`). Wired through to Lucia session cookie. Previously this env var was ignored.
- **GLIBC fix (Ubuntu 24.04)** — Bare command names passed to `nsenter` (initial fix; refined in v1.3.0).

---

## [v1.2.7] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Subscriber nickname field** — Shown in table (accent color) and edit form. Stored in MongoDB alongside Open5GS fields, invisible to core network.
- **Subscriber ICCID field** — Shown in table (monospace) and edit form. SIM Generator auto-provision saves ICCID to subscriber record.
- **pySIM JSON modal fixes** — secp256r1 (Profile B) now extracts compressed key (66 hex chars, 02/03 prefix) matching pySIM and 3GPP TS 33.501.

---

## [v1.2.6] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Full backup download** — Single `.tar.gz` containing all 16 NF config YAMLs + MongoDB dump. Disaster recovery from a single file.
- **Full backup restore** — Upload `.tar.gz` to restore entire system from scratch.
- **MongoDB service tracking** — MongoDB added as tracked service (`mongod` unit). Status circle on topology page. First in restart order since all NFs depend on it.
- **Open5GS internal API integration** — Active sessions and interface status now use Open5GS AMF/MME/SMF APIs directly instead of `tshark`/`conntrack`/`netstat`.
- **UE-to-radio mapping** — RAN Network page shows which eNodeB/gNodeB each UE is connected to.
- **THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md** — License notices for pysim (GPL-2.0), Open5GS (AGPL-3.0), JointJS (MPL-2.0), pyosmocom, pycryptodomex, and npm dependencies.

### Fixed
- **tar directory name bug** — Full backup was failing due to inconsistent directory naming between `mkdir` and `tar` steps.

---
